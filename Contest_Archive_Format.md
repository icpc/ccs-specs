# Contest Archive Format

This page describes the archive format for a contest. It is developed in
parallel with, and makes heavy use of, the [Contest API](contest_api).

There are several reasons that contest information will be stored on
disk, including:

  - As configuration used to initialize a CCS
  - As an archive of what happened in a contest
  - As an archive for replaying a contest, either for testing contest
    tools or for teams to compete against live data
  - As a base for offline analysis

This standard lays out the relative location and format of each type of
contest-related information when reading or writing to disk. The top
level structure is inspired by the [Contest API](contest_api) structure.

## Archive contents

There are four top level directories:

* `config` - configuration and setup
* `registration` - information about particpants
* `events` - detailed information about what happened during the contest
* `results` - end results (this is typically an aggregate of the events)

All JSON and NDJSON files and file directories map to endpoints of the
[Contest API](contest_api) in the following way.

The format of the JSON returned from `<endpoint>` is accepted as the
contents of `<endpoint>`.json (or .ndjson in the case of
`event-feed.ndjson`). Some fields that are required in the contest API
are optional in this file format, to support some non-contest use cases.

Also, all files referenced from the JSON of endpoints are stored in the
`<endpoint>` directory. As such the file reference fields are not
required. They are allowed to be included, so that post processing of
API output is not needed, even if the URIs contained may not work after
a contest (e.g. because they refer to resources on a local network that
is no longer available).

In summary, if a system supports the Contest API it is very simple to
export a correct archive, but it is not required to support the contest
API to be able to use this archive forrmat.

The problem package is not available from the contest API but is stored
using a similar naming convention.

## JSON objects

JSON objects may contain additional fields not described below. Systems
that do not recognize such additional fields should ignore them.
Specifically, the endpoints defined in the [Contest API](contest_api)
contains file references. These files are contained in file packages in
this standard and are thus not contained in the corresponding JSON
objects, but a system may keep those file reference fields in JSON
exported into a contest archive.

### JSON types

The following JSON types are used.

| Name              | Description |
| :---------------- | :---------- |
| string            | Built-in.   |
| number            | Bulit-in.   |
| integer           | Built-in.   |
| boolean           | Built-in.   |
| ID                | A `string` consisting of characters `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` of length at most 36 and not starting with a `-` (dash). IDs must be unique within arrays of JSON objects of its type. |

## Binary files.

Binary files realted to certain object types are stored in a single
parent directory with the same name as the object type and
subdirectories with the same ID as en element of that object type. The
JSON file with the same base name as the parent directory is the parent
JSON file of the files. The name of the subdirectories must match an ID
in the parent JSON file.

If there are no files for some organization (i.e. if a directory would
be empty) it should be omitted.

The naming scheme used for all files is
`<basename>.[.<specifier>].<extension>`. If there are multiple files
with any given basename in a single directory, a specifier must be used
for all except at most one.

For files that are referred to in the Contest API, the file extension
for each file reference should match the mime type in the file reference
object using the following mapping:

| Mime type         | File extension |
| :---------------- | :------------- |
| `image/png`       | `.png`         |
| `image/jpeg`      | `.jpg`         |
| `application/zip` | `.zip`         |
| `text/plain`      | `.txt`         |

### Problem package

Problems packages are strored in a single directory, or alternatively in
a ZIP compressed archive using the file extension `.kpp`, according to
the [Kattis Problem Package
Format](https://www.kattis.com/problem-package-format/) specification.

Problem packages may be left out if (and only if) `config/problems.json`
contains `uuid` for those problems. This assumes that the problems are
stored elsewhere and can be found by macthing by the uuid, and this
should be checked when verifying a contest archive.

### Contest files

The organization directories contain all binary files related to a
single organization in it's parent JSON file. 

The following files could be in the organization directories:
