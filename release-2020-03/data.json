The document\ndefines a set of operations, capabilities, and features which any\ncandidate system must provide, including a set of testability criteria\nwhich must be satisfied and a set of documentation which must be\nprovided.</p>\n<p>The current draft of the requirements document is <em>Version 1.0</em>,\npublished <em><insert publication date></em> by the <em>Competitive Learning\nInstitute</em> (<em><insert CLI website URL></em>). [TODO: insert into the\nprevious sentence the final publication date once the requirements has\nbeen approved; insert official CLI website URL once that has been\ncreated.]</p>\n<p>The primary authors of the document are John Clevenger and Fredrik\nNiemelä, acting under the auspices of the Competitive Learning Institute\n(CLI). Contributors to the document include Samir Ashoo, Per Austrin,\nTroy Boudreau, Tim deBoer, Emma Enström, Mikael Goldman, Gunnar Kreitz,\nDoug Lane, Pehr Söderman, and Mattias de Zalenski.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>For purposes of this requirements document, the term <em>contest control\nsystem</em> (CCS) means software which automatically manages the operation\nof a programming contest. Operations to be managed by the CCS include:\nrunning submissions by teams, judging of submissions, handling\nclarification requests from teams and clarification responses from\njudges, calculation of standings, generating external representations of\ncontest results, and overall CCS configuration.</p>\n<p>A contest control system may be submitted to the Director of Operations\nfor the ICPC World Finals for consideration as a candidate to run the\nWorld Finals. The items which must be submitted in order to be\nconsidered are described under <a href=\"#documentation-requirements\">Documentation\nRequirements</a> in this document. Any\nsubmitted CCS which meets all of the requirements defined in this\ndocument will be certified as being accepted as a candidate to run the\nWorld Finals. Meeting or failing to meet each requirement will be\ndetermined by a test specified by the Director of Operations and/or\nhis/her designee.</p>\n<p>The choice of the CCS actually used to run the World Finals each year\nwill be made by the Director of Operations from among those CCSs which\nhave been accepted as candidates prior to the acceptance deadline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rationale\">Rationale</h3>\n<p>This document is intended to specify functional requirements, not\nimplementation requirements. Nothing in this document should be\nconstrued as requiring any particular implementation architecture or use\nof any particular implementation language or languages. For example, a\nCCS might be implemented as a set of stand-alone applications using a\nclient-server architecture, or might equally well be implemented as a\nset of scripts, web pages, and/or other facilities.</p>\n<p>These requirements are not intended to act as a specification for what\nconstitutes “best practices” in a Contest Control System; rather, it\nacts solely as a specification of what functionality is required to be a\ncandidate for running the ICPC World Finals. As such, there may be\nfunctions listed in this document which are specific solely to the ICPC\nWorld Finals but might not be required for running other contests; a\ncandidate CCS must meet the requirements for these functions.</p>\n<p>Likewise, there may be functionality which a CCS provides to meet the\nrequirements of some other contest; such additional functionality will\nnot disqualify the CCS from qualifying as a candidate to run the ICPC\nWorld Finals provided the CCS meets all the requirements listed in this\ndocument.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-requirements\">General Requirements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"licensing\">Licensing</h3>\n<p>The CCS must either be freely useable, or must be accompanied by a\nlicense granting to the ICPC the non-exclusive, non-revocable,\nnon-transferable rights of use of the CCS both for purposes of\nevaluation and testing and for use in the ICPC World Finals. The CCS may\nnot require obtaining any third-party license in order to be used by the\nICPC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-persistency\">Data Persistency</h3>\n<h4 id=\"contest-configuration-persistency\">Contest Configuration Persistency</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support persistence of the contest configuration. This\nmeans that following a shutdown of the CCS, or a failure on the\nmachine(s) on which the CCS runs, it must be possible to quickly restore\nthe configuration information already entered into the CCS without the\nnecessity of reentering that configuration data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contest-state-persistency\">Contest State Persistency</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support persistence of the contest state once the contest\nhas been started. This means that following a shutdown of the CCS, a\npower or hardware failure on the machine(s) on which the CCS runs, it\nmust be possible to quickly restore the contest state to what it was\nprior to the disruption. The contest state for purposes of this\nrequirement includes all data regarding team submissions, clarification\nrequests, clarifications, judgements, and similar data defining and/or\naffecting the standings of the contest.</p>\n<p>The CCS must not lose more than 1 minute of contest data on a failure of\nany part of the contest system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"account-types\">Account Types</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability of clients to access the system through\ndifferent <em>account types</em>.</p>\n<p>The type of account which a client uses to access the system constrains\nthe functions which the client may perform, as described below.</p>\n<p>At least the following different types of accounts must be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Team: used by teams competing in the contest. The functions\navailable to team clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#team-interface\">team\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Judge: used by judges in the contest. The functions available to\njudge clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#judge-interface\">judge\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Admin: used by contest administrators. The functions available to\nadmin clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#admin-interface\">admin\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"secure-authentication\">Secure Authentication</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support a secure authentication mechanism, allowing each\nregistered user (being either a <a href=\"#team-interface\">team</a>, an\n<a href=\"#admin-interface\">admin</a>, or a\n<a href=\"#judge-interface\">judge</a>) to gain access to the contest, and\nmust ensure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only users who supply correct authentication credentials may invoke\ncontest-related functions.</li>\n<li>Users may only invoke functions corresponding to their\nauthentication credentials. (In other words, it must not be possible\nfor, e.g., a team to invoke functions as if they were some other\nteam, or as if they were a judge.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The CCS may rely on the underlying operating system account\nlogin/password mechanism for purposes of meeting the requirements of\nthis section, provided that it is the case that the CCS enforces all of\nthe requirements of this section, including but not limited to the\nrequirement that users not be allowed to invoke functions as if they\nwere some user other than that specified by their login credentials.</p>\n<h4 id=\"authentication-data\">Authentication Data</h4>\n<p>If the CCS uses a login/password mechanism to enforce secure\nauthentication, it must support account creation and password assignment\naccording to the following algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>read <a href=\"#teamstsv\">teams.tsv</a> defining team accounts to be\ncreated</li>\n<li>read <a href=\"#accountstsv\">accounts.tsv</a> defining additional\naccounts to be created or, for teams, specifying the password of the\naccounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"logging-out\">Logging Out</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support a mechanism for each user to disconnect from the\ncontest, with the effect that no other user of the computer system not\npossessing that team’s authentication credentials will be able to invoke\nCCS functions as if they did possess those credentials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"network-security\">Network Security</h3>\n<p>All communication between CCS modules which takes place over the contest\nnetwork must be encrypted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-outside-contact\">No outside contact</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to run at the World Finals site without contact to\nanything outside the contest network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"timestamps-and-ids\">Timestamps and IDs</h3>\n<p>A timestamp and an integer sequence, called an ID, are assigned to\nsubmissions and clarification requests at the time they enter the\nsystem. The following constraints must be enforced by the CCS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submissions received earlier must have a lower ID than submissions\nreceived later. The same holds for the IDs of clarification\nrequests.</li>\n<li>Timestamps must have at least second granularity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"number-of-problems\">Number of Problems</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 15 problems. Specifically any UI,\nscoreboards or other reports should be fully useable with that number of\nproblems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"number-of-teams\">Number of Teams</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 200 teams.</p>\n<h4 id=\"test-data-files\">Test Data Files</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 200 test data files per problem, a maximum\nsize of 8GB per test data file and a combined size for all test data\nfiles in a problem of 20GB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-at-the-world-finals\">Use At The World Finals</h3>\n<p>In order for a CCS to be selected for use at the World Finals the\nfollowing constraints must be satisfied:</p>\n<h4 id=\"support-personnel\">Support Personnel</h4>\n<p>At least one person from the submitting entity with intimate knowledge\nabout the inner workings of the CCS must be willing and able to attend\nat the World Finals where it is used.</p>\n<h4 id=\"computer-platform\">Computer Platform</h4>\n<p>The CCS must run on the computer platform set aside for the CCS at the\nWorld Finals and posted at the ICPC web site. Normally this will consist\nof one machine per team, several auto-judging machines that are\nidentical to the team machines, and one or more servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contest-configuration\">Contest Configuration</h2>\n<h3 id=\"advance-configuration\">Advance Configuration</h3>\n<p>All variable aspects of the CCS must be configurable prior to the start\nof a World Finals contest. That is, the CCS may not require that any\nchanges be made to the CCS configuration once the contest has started.\nNote that this does not alter any requirements which state that the CCS\nmust allow certain configuration changes to be able to be made after the\ncontest starts; it means that the contest administration staff must not\nbe required to make any changes once the contest starts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"importing-contest-configuration\">Importing Contest Configuration</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to import contest configuration from a single URL,\nand use the data at that location to configure the CCS. The\nconfiguration URL contains all contest configuration data, including the\ncontest configuration file (<a href=\"#contestyaml\">contest.yaml</a>),\nproblemset configuration file\n(<a href=\"#problemsetyaml\">problemset.yaml</a>), problem definitions,\nteams.tsv, groups.tsv and logos.tar.gz. For example, if the URL is\n<a href=\"http://10.1.1.0/data\">http://10.1.1.0/data</a>, teams.tsv can be imported from\n<a href=\"http://10.1.1.0/data/teams.tsv\">http://10.1.1.0/data/teams.tsv</a>.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read <a href=\"#teamstsv\">teams.tsv</a>, which\ncontains a list of teams registered for the World Finals. It must use\nthe data in this file to automatically create whatever internal\nrepresentation is necessary to allow each team (and only the teams)\nspecified in the registration list to participate in the World Finals\ncontest.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read <a href=\"#groupstsv\">groups.tsv</a>, an\ninitialization file containing the list of groups to which the teams\nbelong.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read language configuration from an archive following\nthe <a href=\"https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/contest_archive_format\">Contest Archive Format</a>.\nSee specifically the <a href=\"https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/contest_archive_format#language-object\">language object</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clock-synchronization\">Clock Synchronization</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to synchronize its clock to an NTP server provided\non the contest network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"predefined-clarification-answers\">Predefined Clarification Answers</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support predefined answers to clarification requests, so\nthat judges can choose to reply to a clarification request by selecting\na predefined answer rather than being required to enter a specific\nanswer. At least the following predefined answers must be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No comment, read problem statement.</li>\n<li>This will be answered during the answers to questions session.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"clarification-categories\">Clarification Categories</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support “categories” to which clarification\nrequests can be assigned. A request belongs to exactly one\ncategory. At least the following categories need to be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General</li>\n<li>SysOps</li>\n<li>Operations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the CCS must construct one category per problem, i.e.,\ncategories named e.g. “Problem A”, “Problem B”, etc. for each problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages\">Programming Languages</h3>\n<h4 id=\"supported-languages\">Supported Languages</h4>\n<p>The CCS must provide the ability to compile and execute (or interpret,\nas appropriate for the language) submitted source code files for each of\nthe languages specified by the <a href=\"https://icpc.global/worldfinals/programming-environment\">Environment of the World\nFinals</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"language-options\">Language Options</h4>\n<p>For each supported language compiler or interpreter it must be possible\nto configure the CCS to invoke it with any of the options specified in\nthe compiler or interpreter’s documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contest-problems\">Contest Problems</h3>\n<p>Problems (including judge data, validators, execution time limit, etc)\nare specified and configured using the <a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/\">Problem\npackage format</a>. The CCS must support this format\nwith the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CCS does not have to support the use of the following keys in\nproblem.yaml: type, libraries or languages. This means that the\ndefault value will be used.</li>\n<li>The CCS does only have to support the values “default” or “custom”\nfor the key validation in problem.yaml.</li>\n<li>The CCS does not have to support sections 5 “Included Code”, 9\n“Graders” or 10 “Generators”.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">>TODO: Drop the exceptions above?\n</code></pre>  \n<p>The CCS must report an error when importing problems that use any\nunsupported features. The CCS may report an error when unsupported keys\nare used, even if they are given the default value.</p>\n<p>The problem name is as defined in the <em>problemname</em> macro in the problem\nspecification. Optionally, the <em>plainproblemname</em>, if present, may be\nused instead. If <em>problemname</em> is used then escaped parts of it must be\nhandled properly. If <em>plainproblemname</em> is used it must be used\nverbatim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-change\">Configuration Change</h3>\n<p>The CCS must allow updating of configuration data without restarting or\nstopping the CCS.</p>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability to create and save an updated\ncontest.yaml file upon request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"admin-interface\">Admin Interface</h2>\n<p>This section describes all the required capabilities for users\nauthenticated as admin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"account-disabling\">Account Disabling</h3>\n<p>The CCS must have a mechanism to disable any account (either an account\nfor a human user or for another system), without the need for starting\nor stopping the contest. For example, this includes <a href=\"#secure-authentication\">team\naccounts</a> and judge accounts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changes-to-authentication-data\">Changes To Authentication Data</h3>\n<p>The CCS must allow user authentication credential information to be\nchanged dynamically by contest administration staff while the contest is\nrunning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"starting-the-contest\">Starting the Contest</h3>\n<p>The contest must automatically start when the configured start time is\nreached. It must also be possible to start the contest at the current\ntime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjusting-for-exceptional-circumstances\">Adjusting for Exceptional Circumstances</h3>\n<h4 id=\"removing-time-intervals\">Removing time intervals</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to, potentially retroactively, specify time\nintervals that will be disregarded for the purpose of scoring. The time\nduring all such intervals will not be counted towards a team’s penalty\ntime for solved problems. Beginning and end of time intervals are given\nin wall-clock time.</p>\n<p>Note that removing a time interval changes the wall-clock time when the\ncontest ends, as the duration of the contest in\n<a href=\"#contestyaml\">contest.yaml</a> is specified in contest time.</p>\n<p>Removing the interval between time T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>,\nwhere T<sub>0</sub> ≤ T<sub>1</sub>, means that all submissions received\nbetween T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> will have the same contest time\nand that the time for all submissions received after T<sub>1</sub> will\nhave a contest time that is T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0</sub> lower than if\nthe interval was not removed.</p>\n<p>The removal of a time interval must be reversible. This means that if a\ntime interval is removed, the CCS must support the capability of\nsubsequently restoring the contest to the state it had prior to the\nremoval of the time interval.</p>\n<p>Note that time interval removal does not affect the order in which\nsubmissions arrived to the CCS. If submission S<sub>i</sub> arrived\nbefore submission S<sub>j</sub> during a removed interval, S<sub>i</sub>\nmust still be considered by the CCS to have arrived strictly before\nS<sub>j</sub>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"changing-contest-length\">Changing contest length</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to change the length of the contest at any time\nduring the contest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"adding-penalty-time\">Adding penalty time</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to specify, for each team, an integer, potentially\nnegative, amount of penalty time to be added into that team’s total\npenalty time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ignoring-submissions\">Ignoring submissions</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to remove, ignore or somehow mark a submission so\nthat it in no way affects the scoring of the contest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pausing-judging\">Pausing Judging</h3>\n<p>The CCS must provide some way to temporarily pause judging on a per\nproblem basis. While judging is paused teams should still be able to\nmake submissions and these submission should be shown on the scoreboard\nas usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rejudging\">Rejudging</h3>\n<h4 id=\"automatic-rejudging\">Automatic Rejudging</h4>\n<p>The CCS must allow the ability to automatically rejudge a selected set\nof submissions.</p>\n<p>Each submission in the set of selected submissions is executed and\njudged in the same manner as for a newly arrived submission.</p>\n<h4 id=\"previewing-rejudgement-results\">Previewing Rejudgement Results</h4>\n<p>There must be a way to preview the judgements which result from\nrejudging the set of selected submissions without committing the\nresulting judgements.</p>\n<h4 id=\"submission-selection\">Submission Selection</h4>\n<p>The CCS must provide the ability to specify a filter defining the set of\nsubmissions to be rejudged. The CCS must support any combination of\nfilters of the following types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A specific (single) submission.</li>\n<li>All submissions for a specific problem.</li>\n<li>All submissions using a specific language.</li>\n<li>All submissions by a specific team or set of teams.</li>\n<li>All submissions between some time T<sub>0</sub> and some subsequent\ntime T<sub>1</sub>.</li>\n<li>All submissions which have been assigned any specific one of the\nallowable submission judgments as defined in <a href=\"#judge-responses\">Judge\nResponses</a>, or all submissions that\nreceived any judgment other than “Accepted” (that is, all rejected\nsubmissions).</li>\n<li>All submissions which have been run on a specific computer\n(identified in some reasonable way, e.g., IP address or hostname).\nThis requirement is only applicable if the CCS uses multiple\nmachines to run submissions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, for example, it must be possible to select “all rejected\nsubmissions for problem B”, “all Time Limit Exceeded submissions using\nJava for problem C”, “all submissions between time 2013-07-01\n08:00:00+00 and time 2013-07-01 09:00:00+00 of the contest using Java”,\nor “all submissions using C++”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manual-override-of-judgments\">Manual Override of Judgments</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability to assign, to a single submission, an\nupdated judgment chosen from among any of the allowed submission\njudgments as defined in <a href=\"#judge-responses\">Judge\nResponses</a>.</p>\n<p>The CCS must require a separate authentication every time a judgment is\nchanged manually and all such changes must be logged.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scoreboard-display\">Scoreboard Display</h3>\n<p>The CCS must provide a mechanism for judges to view the current\nscoreboard. The scoreboard must be updated in such a way that it’s never\nmore than 30 seconds out of date.</p>\n<p>During times when the scoreboard is frozen, administrators must be able\nto view the current (updated) scoreboard as well as the frozen\nscoreboard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"freezing-the-scoreboard\">Freezing the Scoreboard</h3>\n<p>The scoreboard must automatically freeze when the configured scoreboard\nfreeze time is reached. It must also be possible to manually freeze the\nscoreboard at the current time. All submissions received after the\nfreeze time must be treated as pending on a frozen scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The exact phrase displayed on the frozen scoreboard must be:</p>\n<p><code>The scoreboard was frozen with XX minutes remaining - submissions in the last XX minutes of the contest are still shown as pending.</code></p>\n<p>where XX is the number of minutes remaining in the contest at the time\nthe scoreboard was frozen.</p>\n<p>It must be possible to re-enable scoreboard display updating at any time\nafter it has been disabled, again without stopping the contest or\naffecting contest operations in any way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finalizing-the-contest\">Finalizing the Contest</h3>\n<p>Finalizing is the procedure to authorize the final results at the end of\na contest. When the contest has been finalized the\n<a href=\"contest_api#contest-state\">contest state</a> endpoint will be updated to\nreflect this.</p>\n<p>When the contest is over, but not finalized, all scoreboards must show a\nwarning that the results are not final.</p>\n<p>The CCS must provide a way for admins to finalize the contest. It must\n<em>not</em> be possible to finalize a contest if one or more of the following\napplies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The contest is still running (i.e., the contest is not over).</li>\n<li>There are un-judged submissions.</li>\n<li>There are submissions judged as\n<a href=\"#exceptional-judgments\">Judging Error</a>.</li>\n<li>There are unanswered clarification requests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before finalizing the contest the value B, as used in\n<a href=\"#scoring-data-generation\">Scoring Data Generation</a> will be provided.\nThe default value for B must be 0.</p>\n<p>If, after providing the correct and final value of B, the\n<a href=\"contest_api#scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> and <a href=\"contest_api#awards\">Awards</a>\nendpoints contain the correct results, the admin may Finalize the\ncontest. These endpoints must be compared with the ones exposed by the\n<a href=\"#shadow-mode\">Shadow CCS</a> and should also be manually sanity checked\nbefore Finalizing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team-interface\">Team Interface</h2>\n<p>This section describes all the required capabilities for users\nauthenticated as team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submissions\">Submissions</h3>\n<p>For purposes of this document, solutions to problems submitted for\njudging are called <strong>submissions</strong>.

Participants in a WF contest (teams, judges, contest\nadministrators, etc.) connect only to the Primary CCS; all\nparticipant-visible contest operations are handled by the Primary CCS\nand the final results of the contest are computed by the Primary CCS.</p>\n<p>In order to insure accuracy of the final contest results, each World\nFinals also runs an independent “parallel” CCS called the <em>Shadow CCS</em>.\nThe main task of the Shadow CCS is to verify that the final results\ncomputed by the Primary CCS are correct according to the rules of the\nWorld Finals. A contest control system acting as a Shadow CCS is said to\nbe running in <em>shadow mode</em>. This section defines requirements which\nmust be implemented by a CCS related to shadow mode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-both-primary-and-shadow-modes\">Support for both Primary and Shadow Modes</h3>\n<p>A CCS must be able to operate in either Primary or Shadow mode. This\nmeans that it must in principle be possible to run two identical\ninstances of the CCS, one set to run in Primary mode and the other set\nto run in Shadow mode, and where the two CCS instances communicate with\neach other as defined by the requirements of this section and where each\nCCS instance performs all of the required operations of a Primary or\nShadow CCS respectively. A CCS will not be considered as a candidate for\nuse at the World Finals unless it meets all of the requirements\nspecified in this document, including all of the requirements listed in\nthis section. That is, a CCS will not be considered as a candidate for\nuse at the World Finals unless it is capable of operating both as a\nPrimary CCS and as a Shadow CCS.</p>\n<p>The requirement for the ability to run in either Primary mode or Shadow\nmode does not imply that a CCS must be able to operate in these modes\nsimultaneously, nor that a CCS must be able to switch between these\nmodes dynamically during a contest. Rather, it means that in order to be\neligible to be a candidate for use at the World Finals, a CCS must\nsupport BOTH Primary and Shadow-mode operations and must meet all of the\nrequirements for both modes, regardless of which mode it would actually\nbe used in for the particular World Finals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"external-communication\">External Communication</h3>\n<p>Beyond communicating with its own components (e.g., communicating with\nits external “auto-judges” or with the humans managing it), the only\nexternal communication which a CCS running in shadow mode is allowed to\nrequire is that it has the ability to communicate with at least one\n“server” component of the Primary CCS. In particular, a CCS running in\nshadow mode may not require that it be able to communicate directly with\nany of the actual contest participants (meaning the teams, judges, or\ncontest administrators who communicate with the Primary CCS).</p>\n<p>Said another way, the Shadow CCS must be able to perform all of its\nfunctions while communicating only with the Primary CCS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ccs-configuration\">CCS Configuration</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must be able to import a complete contest\nconfiguration as described in the <a href=\"#importing-contest-configuration\">Importing Contest\nConfiguration</a> section of\nthis Requirements Specification. In particular a shadow-mode CCS must be\nable to import a contest configuration from a single URL and must also\nbe able to import the teams.tsv and groups.tsv files as specified in\nthat section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submissions-1\">Submissions</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must be able to obtain team submissions via\ncommunication with the Primary CCS. As required elsewhere in this\nspecification, the Primary CCS must implement the endpoints defined\nin the <a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a>. The following\nrequirements then apply to the mechanisms used by the Shadow CCS for\nobtaining submissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Shadow CCS should use the <code>/event-feed</code> endpoint defined in the\n<a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> to obtain notification of team\nsubmissions from the Primary CCS (in other words, the Shadow CCS\nshould preferably use event-driven operation, rather than polling,\nfor team submission notification).</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must use the <code>/submissions/&lt;id&gt;</code> and\n<code>/submissions/&lt;id&gt;/files</code> endpoints defined in the\n<a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> for obtaining submission data from the\nPrimary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must provide an interface that can display\ninformation regarding any submission by looking up the submission\nusing the submission id assigned by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must use the timestamp assigned to a submission by\nthe Primary CCS as the time of the submission for purposes of\ncomputing standings, regardless of the time at which the submission\nis actually obtained by the Shadow CCS.</li>\n<li>A submission obtained from the Primary CCS must be executed and\njudged by the Shadow CCS in the same manner as if it had been\nsubmitted to the CCS running in non-shadow mode.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"judgement-comparison\">Judgement Comparison</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must the capability to present a “diff” of\nsubmissions – that is, a list of all submissions which at the current\ntime have a different judgement than that which was assigned by the\nPrimary CCS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"requirements-which-may-be-imposed-by-the-ccs\">Requirements Which May Be Imposed By The CCS</h3>\n<p>A CCS may require the following conditions to exist in order to\nguarantee support for shadow-mode operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Shadow CCS is provided with “auto-judging” hardware which is the\nsame as that being used by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS has a network connection to both the Event Feed and\nthe REST services provided by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS is provided with credentials which allow appropriate\naccess to the required Primary CCS REST endpoints.</li>\n<li>SubmissionIDs for submissions are unique contest-wide, even in the\nevent of a contest with multiple independent sites being managed by\na single distributed Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS has access to the same contest configuration files as\nthose used to configure the Primary CCS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A CCS may not require any conditions not specified above to exist in\norder to guarantee support for shadow-mode operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation-requirements\">Documentation Requirements</h2>\n<p>In order for a given CCS to be considered as a candidate for running the\nICPC World Finals contest, the following documents must be submitted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A text file named “License” containing the license, conforming to\nthe the <a href=\"#licensing\">Licensing</a> section, under which the\nCCS is made available to the ICPC.</li>\n<li>A <em>Requirements Compliance Document</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Team Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Judge’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Contest Administrator’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>System Manager’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"requirements-compliance-document\">Requirements Compliance Document</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a <em>Requirements Compliance Document</em> in PDF format,\nthat for each requirement (referencing by section number) in this\ndocument confirms that the CCS conforms and explains how that is. In the\nevent that a configuration item is provided by using services of the\nunderlying operating system rather than facilities directly implemented\nor controlled by the CCS itself, this fact must be explicitly stated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"team-guide\">Team Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Team Guide” in PDF format. The Team Guide must\nprovide all the necessary instructions showing how a contest team uses\nthe functions of the team interface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"judges-guide\">Judge’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Judge’s Guide” in PDF format. The Judge’s Guide\nmust provide all the necessary instructions showing how a human contest\njudge uses the functions of the human judge interface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contest-administrators-guide\">Contest Administrator’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Contest Administrator’s Guide” in PDF format.\nThe Administrator’s Guide must provide all the necessary instructions\nshowing how contest personnel use the functions of the CCS to set up and\nmanage a contest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-managers-guide\">System Manager’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “System Manager’s Guide” document in PDF format.\nThe System Manager’s Guide must describe the steps required to install\nand start the CCS on the OS platform specified for use in the World\nFinals. In the event that the CCS consists of multiple modules and/or\npackages, the guide must contain a description of the relationship\nbetween the modules or packages, including any specific installation\nand/or startup steps required for each module or package.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must provide instructions to contest\npersonnel explaining situations (if any) where the CCS uses functions of\nthe underlying operating system (OS) platform to meet requirements laid\nout in this document. For example, if the CCS relies on the use of OS\naccount and password management to implement requirements related to\ncontest security and credentials, or print services provided by the OS\nto implement requirements related to external notifications, this must\nbe described in the System Manager’s Guide.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must explicitly list any operating system\ndependencies of the CCS, including but not limited to which OS platform\nand version are required and which optional OS packages must be\ninstalled for the CCS to function properly.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must explicitly list any software\ndependencies of the CCS. For example, any tools such as Java, PERL,\nWebServer, Browser, database systems, etc., which are required for\ncorrect operation of the CCS must be listed in the guide, including\nspecific version

It is meant to\nincorporate and supersede a number of\n<a href=\"https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page#Deprecated.2C_Old.2C_and_Orphaned_Specifications\">deprecated or obsolete specifications</a> amongst which the <em>JSON Scoreboard</em>, the\n<em>REST interface for source code fetching</em>\nand the <em>Contest start interface</em>.</p>\n<p>This REST interface is specified in conjunction with a new\n<a href=\"#event-feed\">NDJSON event feed</a>, which provides all changes to this\ninterface as CRUD-style events and is meant to supersede the old XML\n<em>Event Feed</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-design-principles\">General design principles</h2>\n<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,\n“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in\n<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt\">RFC 2119</a>.</p>\n<p>The interface is implemented as a HTTP REST interface that outputs\ninformation in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> format\n(<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159\">RFC 7159</a>).

However,\nfor future compatibility below are already listed other methods with\ntheir expected behavior, if implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GET</code>\nRead data. This method is idempotent and does not modify any data.\nIt can be used to request a whole collection or a specific element.</li>\n<li><code>POST</code>\nCreate a new element. This can only be called on a collection\nendpoint. No <code>id</code> attribute should be specified as it is up to the\nserver to assign one, which is returned in the location header.</li>\n<li><code>PUT</code>\nReplaces a specific element. This method is idempotent and can only\nbe called on a specific element and replaces its contents with the\ndata provided. The payload data must be complete, i.e. no partial\nupdates are allowed. The <code>id</code> attribute cannot be changed: it does\nnot need to be specified (other than in the URL) and if specified\ndifferent from in the URL, a <code>409 Conflict</code> HTTP code should be\nreturned.</li>\n<li><code>PATCH</code>\nUpdates/modifies a specific element. Similar to <code>PUT</code> but allows\npartial updates by providing only that data, for example:\n<code>PATCH https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/teams/10</code>\nwith JSON contents\n<code>{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Our cool new team name&quot;}</code>\nNo updates of the <code>id</code> attribute are allowed either.</li>\n<li><code>DELETE</code>\nDelete a specific element. Idempotent, but may return a 404 status\ncode when repeated. Any provided data is ignored. Example:\n<code>DELETE https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/teams/8</code>\nNote that deletes must keep <a href=\"#referential-integrity\">referential\nintegrity</a> intact.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\">HTTP status\ncodes</a> are\nreturned to indicate success or failure. When there is a failure (status codes 4xx or 5xx), the\nresponse message body must include a JSON element that contains the attributes ‘code’ (a number, identical to the HTTP status code returned) and ‘message’ (a string) with further information suitable for the user making the request, as per the following example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nl\">\"code\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">403</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n </span><span class=\"nl\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Teams cannot send clarifications to another team\"</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<h3 id=\"roles\">Roles</h3>\n<p>Access to this API is controlled via user roles. The API provider must\nrequire authentication to access each role except for optionally the\npublic role. The API provider must support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\">HTTP basic\nauthentication</a>\n(<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617\">RFC</a>). This provides a standard\nand flexible method; besides HTTP basic auth, other forms of\nauthentication can be offered as well.</p>\n<p>Each provider must support at least the following roles, although\nadditional roles may be supported for specific uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>public (default role: contest data that’s available to everyone)</li>\n<li>admin (data or capability only available to contest administrators)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Role-based access may completely hide some objects from the user, may\nomit certain attributes, or may embargo or omit objects based on the\ncurrent contest time. By default, the public user has read-only access\n(no <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code> or <code>DELETE</code> methods allowed) and does\nnot have access to judgements and runs from submissions made after the\ncontest freeze time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"referential-integrity\">Referential integrity</h3>\n<p>Some attributes in elements are references to IDs of other elements.\nWhen such an attribute has a non-<code>null</code> value, then the referenced\nelement must exist. That is, the full set of data exposed by the API\nmust at all times be referentially intact. This implies for example that\nbefore creating a <a href=\"#teams\">team</a> with an <code>organization_id</code>,\nthe <a href=\"#organizations\">organization</a> must already exist. In\nreverse, that organization can only be deleted after the team is\ndeleted, or alternatively, the team’s <code>organization_id</code> is set to\n<code>null</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the ID attribute (see below) of elements are not allowed to\nchange. However, note that a particular ID might be reused by first\ndeleting an element and then creating a new element with the same ID.</p>\n<h3 id=\"json-attribute-types\">JSON attribute types</h3>\n<p>Attribute types are specified as one of the standard JSON types, or one of the\nmore specific types defined below. Implementations must be consistent with\nrespect to the optional parts of each type, e.g. if the optional .uuu is\nincluded in any absolute timestamp it must be included when outputting all\nabsolute timestamps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strings (type <strong><code>string</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON strings.</li>\n<li>Numbers (type <strong><code>number</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON numbers.</li>\n<li>Booleans (type <strong><code>boolean</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON booleans.</li>\n<li>Integers\n(type <strong><code>integer</code></strong> in the specification) are JSON numbers that are\nrestricted to be integer. They should be represented in standard\ninteger representation <code>(-)?[0-9]+</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixed point numbers\n(type <strong><code>decimal</code></strong> in the specification) are JSON numbers that are\nexpected to take non-integer values. They must be in decimal\n(non-scientific) representation and have at most 3 decimals. That\nis, they must be a integer multiple of 0.001.</li>\n<li>Absolute timestamps\n(type <strong><code>TIME</code></strong> in the specification) are strings containing\nhuman-readable timestamps, given in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> extended combined\ndate/time format with timezone:\n<code>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss(.uuu)?[+-]zz(:mm)?</code> (or timezone <code>Z</code> for UTC).</li>\n<li>Relative times\n(type <strong><code>RELTIME</code></strong> in the specification) are strings containing\nhuman-readable time durations, given in a slight modification of the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> extended time\nformat: <code>(-)?(h)*h:mm:ss(.uuu)?</code></li>\n<li>Identifiers\n(type <strong><code>ID</code></strong> in the specification) are given as string consisting\nof characters <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]</code> of length at most 36 and not starting\nwith a <code>-</code> (dash) or <code>.</code> (dot) or ending with a <code>.</code> (dot). IDs are\nunique within each endpoint. IDs are assigned by the person or system\nthat is the source of the object, and must be maintained by downstream\nsystems. For example, the person configuring a contest on disk will\ntypically define the ID for each team, and any CCS or CDS that exposes\nthe team must use the same ID.\nSome IDs are also used as identifiable labels and are marked below\nalong with the recommended format. These IDs should be meaningful\nfor human communication (e.g. team “43”, problem “A”) and are as\nshort as reasonable but not more than 10 characters. IDs not marked\nas labels may be random characters and cannot be assumed to be\nsuitable for display purposes.</li>\n<li>Ordinals\n(type <strong><code>ORDINAL</code></strong> in the specification) are used to give an\nexplicit order to a list of objects. Ordinal attributes are integers\nand must be non-negative and unique in a list of objects, and they\nshould typically be low numbers starting from zero. However, clients\nmust not assume that the ordinals start at zero nor that they are\nsequential. Instead the ordinal values should be used to sort the\nlist of objects.</li>\n<li>File references\n(types <strong><code>IMAGE</code></strong>, <strong><code>VIDEO</code></strong>, <strong><code>ARCHIVE</code></strong> and <strong><code>STREAM</code></strong> in\nthe specification) are represented as a JSON object with elements as\ndefined below.</li>\n<li>Arrays (type <strong><code>array of &lt;type&gt;</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON\narrays of some type defined above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Element for file reference objects:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Nullable?</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>href</td>\n<td>string</td>\n<td>no</td>\n<td>URL where the resource can be found.

For example, if\n<code>baseurl</code> is <a href=\"https://example.com/api\">https://example.com/api</a>, then the following are\nequivalent JSON response snippets pointing to the same location:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/submissions/187/files\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"contests/wf14/submissions/187/files\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<p>For images, the supported mime types are image/png and image/jpeg.</p>\n<p>If implementing support for uploading files pointed to by resource\nlinks, substitute the href element with a data element with a base64\nencoded string of the associated file contents as the value.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<p><code>POST https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/organizations</code></p>\n<p>with JSON data</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"inst105\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Carnegie Mellon University\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"err\">...</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"logo\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"nl\">\"data\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;base64 string&gt;\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"width\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">160</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"height\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">160</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<h3 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h3>\n<p>This specification is meant to cover the basic data of contests, with\nthe idea that server/client implementations can extend this with more\ndata and/or roles. In particular, this specification already lists some\nendpoints or specific attributes as optional. The following guidelines\nare meant to ease extensibility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients should accept extra attributes in endpoints, that are not\nspecified here.</li>\n<li>Servers should not expect clients to recognize more than the basic,\nrequired specification.</li>\n<li>In this specification and extensions, an attribute with value <code>null</code>\nmay be left out by the server (i.e. not be present). A client must\ntreat an attribute with value <code>null</code> equivalently as that attribute\nnot being present.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"interface-specification\">Interface specification</h2>\n<p>The following list of API endpoints should be supported. Note that\n<code>state</code>, <code>scoreboard</code> and <code>event-feed</code> are singular nouns and indeed\ncontain only a single element.</p>\n<p>All endpoints should support <code>GET</code>; specific details on other methods\nare mentioned below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"types-of-endpoints\">Types of endpoints</h3>\n<p>The endpoints can be categorized into 3 groups as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configuration: contests, judgement-types, languages, problems,\ngroups, organizations, teams, team-members;</li>\n<li>Live data: state, submissions, judgements, runs, clarifications,\nawards;</li>\n<li>Aggregate data: scoreboard, event-feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Configuration is normally set before contest start. Is not expected to,\nbut could occasionally be updated during a contest. It does not have\nassociated timestamp/contest time attributes. Updates are notified via\nthe event feed.</p>\n<p>Live data is generated during the contest and new elements are expected.\nData is immutable though: only inserts, no updates or deletes of\nelements. It does have associated timestamp/contest time attributes.\nInserts and deletes are notified via the event feed. <strong>Note</strong>:\njudgements are the exception to immutability in a weak sense: they get\nupdated once with the final verdict.</p>\n<p>Aggregate data: Only <code>GET</code> makes sense. These are not included in the\nevent feed, also note that these should not be considered proper REST\nendpoints, and that the <code>event-feed</code> endpoint is a streaming feed in\nNDJSON format.</p>\n<h3 id=\"table-column-description\">Table column description</h3>\n<p>In the tables below, the columns are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Attribute name; object sub-attributes are indicated as\n<code>object.attribute</code>.</li>\n<li>Type: Data type of the attribute; one of the\n<a href=\"#json-attribute-types\">types listed above</a>.</li>\n<li>Required?: Whether this is a required attribute that <strong>must</strong> be\nimplemented to conform to this specification.</li>\n<li>Nullable?: Whether the attribute might be <code>null</code> (and thus\nimplicitly can also not be present in that case).</li>\n<li>Description: Description of the meaning of the attribute and any\nspecial considerations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that attributes with <code>null</code> value may be left out by the server.\nFurthermore, optional attributes must still be consistently implemented\n(or not) *within* each contest. This implies the following for\nattributes that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Required and not nullable: The attribute must always be present with\na value.</li>\n<li>Required and nullable: The attribute may be <code>null</code>, and only in that\ncase it may be left out.</li>\n<li>Optional and not nullable: The attribute may not be implemented, but\nthat implies that no element of the endpoint has the attribute set.\nIf one element has this attribute present, then it must be not\n<code>null</code> and the same must be true for all same type elements within\nthe contest.</li>\n<li>Optional and nullable: The attribute may be <code>null</code> or not present.\nIn the latter case that can either be because it was a left out\n<code>null</code> value or because it was not implemented.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"contests\">Contests</h3>\n<p>Provides information on the current contest.</p>\n<p>The following endpoint is associated with contest:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Endpoint</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mime-type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Required?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>/contests</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">application/json</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">JSON array of all contests with elements as defined in the table below.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">application/json</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">JSON object of a single contest with elements as defined in the table below.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>JSON elements of contest objects:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Required?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Nullable?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">id</td>\n<td align=\"left\">ID</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">no</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Identifier of the current contest.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">name</td>\n<td align=\"left\">string</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">no</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Short display name of the contest.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">formal_name</td>\n<td align=\"left\">string</td>\n<td align=\"left\">no</td>\n<td align=\"left\">no</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Full name of the contest.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">start_time</td>\n<td align=\"left\">TIME</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The scheduled start time of the contest, may be <code>null</code> if the start time is unknown or the countdown is paused.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">countdown_pause_time</td>\n<td align=\"left\">RELTIME</td>\n<td align=\"left\">no</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The amount of seconds left when countdown to contest start is paused.

This can also be\nseen by the fact that there is no scoreboard event in the table of\nevents below.</p>\n<p>Since this is generated data, only the <code>GET</code> method is allowed here,\nirrespective of role.</p>\n<p>The following endpoint is associated with the event feed:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Endpoint</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mime-type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Required?</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/event-feed</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">application/x-ndjson</td>\n<td align=\"left\">yes</td>\n<td align=\"left\">NDJSON feed of events as defined below.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Multiple requests of the event feed must return the exact same events in\nthe exact same order, except that events filtered out by the feed\noptions must be left out and new elements, if any, are added in later\nrequests.</p>\n<p>The event feed is a streaming endpoint that does not terminate under\nnormal circumstances.

The client only receives create, update and delete\nevents of elements it has (partial) access to.

It is developed in\nparallel with, and makes heavy use of, the <a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a>.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons that contest information will be stored on\ndisk, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As configuration used to initialize a CCS</li>\n<li>As an archive of what happened in a contest</li>\n<li>As an archive for replaying a contest, either for testing contest\ntools or for teams to compete against live data</li>\n<li>As a base for offline analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This standard lays out the relative location and format of each type of\ncontest-related information when reading or writing to disk. The top\nlevel structure is inspired by the <a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> structure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"archive-contents\">Archive contents</h2>\n<p>There are four top level directories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>config</code> - configuration and setup</li>\n<li><code>registration</code> - information about particpants</li>\n<li><code>events</code> - detailed information about what happened during the contest</li>\n<li><code>results</code> - end results (this is typically an aggregate of the events)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All JSON and NDJSON files and file directories map to endpoints of the\n<a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> in the following way.</p>\n<p>The format of the JSON returned from <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> is accepted as the\ncontents of <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code>.json (or .ndjson in the case of\n<code>event-feed.ndjson</code>). Some fields that are required in the contest API\nare optional in this file format, to support some non-contest use cases.</p>\n<p>Also, all files referenced from the JSON of endpoints are stored in the\n<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> directory. As such the file reference fields are not\nrequired. They are allowed to be included, so that post processing of\nAPI output is not needed, even if the URIs contained may not work after\na contest (e.g. because they refer to resources on a local network that\nis no longer available).</p>\n<p>In summary, if a system supports the Contest API it is very simple to\nexport a correct archive, but it is not required to support the contest\nAPI to be able to use this archive forrmat.</p>\n<p>The problem package is not available from the contest API but is stored\nusing a similar naming convention.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">File
