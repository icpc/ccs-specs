== Introduction ==

This document specifies a standard for operation, verification and validation
of Programming Contest Control Systems that wish to be considered for managing
the operation of the [http://icpc.baylor.edu ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]
[http://cm.baylor.edu/ICPCWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=World%20Finals World Finals]. 
The document defines a set of operations, capabilities, and features which
any candidate system must provide, including a set of testability criteria which must
be satisfied and a set of documentation which must be provided.

The current draft of the standard is ''Version 1.0'', published ''<insert publication date>'' by the 
''Competitive Learning Institute'' (''<insert CLI website URL>'').   [TODO: insert into the previous sentence the 
final publication date once the standard has been approved; insert official CLI website URL once that has been created.]

The primary authors of the document are John Clevenger and Fredrik Niemelä,
acting under the auspices of the Competitive Learning Institute (CLI).
Contributors to the document include Samir Ashoo, Per Austrin, Troy Boudreau, Tim deBoer, Emma Enström, Mikael Goldman, Gunnar Kreitz, 
Doug Lane, Pehr Söderman, and Mattias de Zalenski.

=== Overview === 

For purposes of this standard, the term ''contest control system'' (CCS) means
software which automatically manages the operation of a programming contest.
Operations to be managed by the CCS include: running submissions by teams, judging of submissions, handling clarification
requests from teams and clarification responses from judges, calculation of
standings, generating external representations of contest results, and overall CCS configuration.

A contest control system may be submitted to the Director of
Operations for the ICPC World Finals for consideration as a candidate to run the
World Finals. The items which must be submitted in order to be considered are
described under [[#Certification Process| Certification Process]] in this standard. Any submitted CCS
which meets all of the requirements defined in this standard will be certified as being
accepted as a candidate to run the World Finals. Meeting or failing to
meet each requirement will be determined by a test specified by the Director of
Operations and/or his/her designee.

The choice of the CCS actually used to run the World Finals each year will be
made by the Director of Operations from among those CCSs which have been
accepted as candidates prior to the acceptance deadline.

=== Rationale ===

This standard is intended to specify functional requirements, not
implementation requirements. Nothing in this standard should be construed as
requiring any particular implementation architecture or use of any particular
implementation language or languages. For example, a CCS might be implemented
as a set of stand-alone applications using a client-server architecture, or might
equally well be implemented as a set of scripts, web pages, and/or other facilities.

This standard is not intended to act as a specification for what constitutes
"best practices" in a Contest Control System; rather, it acts solely as a specification
of what functionality is required to be a candidate for running the ICPC World Finals.
As such, there may be functions listed in this standard which are specific solely to
the ICPC World Finals but might not be required for running other contests; a
candidate CCS must meet the requirements for these functions.

Likewise, there may be functionality which a CCS provides to meet the
requirements of some other contest; such additional functionality will not disqualify
the CCS from qualifying as a candidate to run the ICPC World Finals provided the
CCS meets all the requirements listed in this standard.

== General Requirements ==

=== Licensing ===

The CCS must either be freely useable, or must be accompanied by a license granting to the ACM-ICPC the non-exclusive, non-revocable, non-transferable rights of use of the CCS both for purposes of evaluation and testing and for use in the ICPC World Finals. The CCS may not require obtaining any third-party license in order to be used by the ACM-ICPC.

=== Data Persistency ===

==== Contest Configuration Persistency ====

The CCS must support persistence of the contest configuration. This means that following a shutdown of the CCS, or a failure on the machine(s) on which the CCS runs, it must be possible to quickly restore the configuration information already entered into the CCS without the necessity of reentering that configuration data.

==== Contest State Persistency ====

The CCS must support persistence of the contest state once the contest has been started. This means that following a shutdown of the CCS, or a power failure on the machine(s) on which the CCS runs, it must be possible to quickly restore the contest state to what it was prior to the shutdown or power failure. The contest state for purposes of this requirement includes all data regarding team submissions, clarification requests, clarifications, judgements, and similar data defining and/or affecting the standings of the contest.

The CCS must not lose more than 1 minute of contest data on a failure of any part of the contest system.

==== Data Backup ====

The CCS must support a mechanism that allows the contest to continue with minimal disruption in case of hardware failure. This means for example that the CCS must arrange that all contest data is continually backed up in a way that allows the contest to be restored to its current state in the event of a single hard disk failure, loss of network connection, or other similar failure.

=== Account Types ===

The CCS must support the ability of clients to access the system through different ''account types''.  

The type of account which a client uses to access the system constrains the functions which the client may perform, as described below.

At least the following different types of accounts must be supported:

* Team: used by teams competing in the contest.  The functions available to team clients are as defined in the section on the [[#Team Interface|team interface]].

* Judge: used by judges in the contest.  The functions available to judge clients are as defined in the section on the [[#Judge Interface|judge interface]]. 

* Admin: used by contest administrators. The functions available to admin clients are as defined in the section on the [[#Admin Interface|admin interface]].

* Analyst: used by ICPC-Live Analysts. The functions available to analyst clients are a subset of those available to judges; specifically, analyst clients have precisely those capabilities defined in [[#Simultaneous_Usage|simultaneous usage]] and those defined in [[#Viewing Runs|viewing runs]], plus the capability of viewing the scoreboard as seen by the teams (as defined in [[#Scoreboard_Display_2|team scoreboard]]).

=== Secure Authentication ===

The CCS must support a secure authentication mechanism, allowing each registered user (being either a [[#Team_Interface|team]], an [[#Admin_Interface|admin]], a [[#Judge_Interface|judge]], or an analyst) to gain access to the contest, and must ensure that:
# Only users who supply correct authentication credentials may invoke contest-related functions.
# Users may only invoke functions corresponding to their authentication credentials.  (In other words, it must not be possible for, e.g., a team to invoke functions as if they were some other team, or as if they were a judge.)

The CCS may rely on the underlying operating system account login/password mechanism for purposes of meeting the requirements of this section, provided that it is the case that the CCS enforces all of the requirements of this section, including but not limited to the requirement that users not be allowed to invoke functions as if they were some user other than that specified by their login credentials.

==== Authentication Data ====

If the CCS uses a login/password mechanism to enforce secure authentication, it must support account creation and password assignment according to the following algorithm:

# read [[#teams.tsv|teams.tsv]] defining team accounts to be created
# read [[#accounts.tsv| accounts.tsv]] defining additional accounts to be created (that is, accounts in addition to teams)
# read [[#passwords.txt|passwords.txt]] a list of passwords to be assigned
# assign passwords to accounts, deterministically (that is, the same password mapping must be produced if the same data is input a second time)
# generate a file '''userdata.tsv''' containing user account information in the format described in [[#userdata.tsv| userdata.tsv]].

==== Logging Out ====

The CCS must support a mechanism for each user to disconnect from the contest, with the effect that no other user of the computer system not possessing that team<nowiki>'</nowiki>s authentication credentials will be able to invoke CCS functions as if they did possess those credentials.

=== Network Security ===

All communication between CCS modules which takes place over the contest network must be encrypted.

=== No outside contact ===

The CCS must be able to run at the World Finals site without contact to anything outside the contest network.

=== Timestamps and IDs ===

A timestamp and an integral sequence number, called an ID, are assigned to submissions and clarification requests at the time they enter the system.  The following constraints must be enforced by the CCS:
*The ID sequences are separate for submissions and clarification requests; i.e., there is both a submission with ID 1 and a clarification request with ID 1.
* The first submission to enter the system must have submission ID 1, and similarly the first clarification request to enter the system must have clarification request ID 1.
* IDs always increase by one (that is, any new submission which enters the system must have a submission id which is one greater than the previous submission to enter the system, and similarly for clarification request IDs).
* Submissions received earlier must have a lower ID than submissions received later. The same holds for the IDs of clarification requests.
* Timestamps must have at least second granularity.

=== Limitations ===

==== Number of Problems ====

The CCS must support at least 15 problems. Specifically any UI, scoreboards or other reports should be fully useable with that number of problems.

==== Number of Teams ====

The CCS must support at least 200 teams.

==== Test Data Files ====

The CCS must support at least 200 test data files per problem, a maximum size of 8GB per test data file and a combined size for all test data files in a problem of 20GB.

=== Use At The World Finals ===

In order for a CCS to be selected for use at the World Finals the following constraints must be satisfied:

====Support Personnel ====

At least one person from the submitting entity with intimate knowledge about the inner workings of the CCS must be willing and able to attend at the World Finals where it is used.

==== Computer Platform ====

The CCS must run on the computer platform set aside for the CCS at the World Finals and posted at the ICPC web site. Normally this will consist of one machine per team, several auto-judging machines that are identical to the team machines, and one or more servers.

== Contest Configuration ==

=== Advance Configuration ===

All variable aspects of the CCS must be configurable prior to the start of a World Finals contest. That is, the CCS may not require that any changes be made to the CCS configuration once the contest has started. Note that this does not alter any requirements which state that the CCS must allow certain configuration changes to be able to be made after the contest starts; it means that the contest administration staff must not be required to make any changes once the contest starts.

=== Importing Contest Configuration ===

The CCS must be able to import contest configuration from a single URL, and use the data at that location to configure the CCS. The configuration URL contains all contest configuration data, including the contest configuration file ([[#contest.yaml|contest.yaml]]), problemset configuration file ([[#problemset.yaml|problemset.yaml]]), problem definitions, teams.tsv, groups.tsv and logos.tar.gz. For example, if the URL is http://10.1.1.0/data, teams.tsv can be imported from http://10.1.1.0/data/teams.tsv.

The CCS must be able to read [[#teams.tsv|teams.tsv]], which contains a list of teams registered for the World Finals. It must use the data in this file to automatically create whatever internal representation is necessary to allow each team (and only the teams) specified in the registration list to participate in the World Finals contest.

The CCS must be able to read [[#groups.tsv|groups.tsv]], an initialization file containing the list of groups to which the teams belong.

=== Clock Synchronization ===

The CCS must be able to synchronize its clock to an NTP server provided on the contest network. 

=== Predefined Clarification Answers ===

The CCS must be able to configure predefined answers to clarification requests (e.g., "No response, read problem statement." and "This will be answered after the practice session.") from the [[#contest.yaml | contest configuration file]], so that judges can choose to reply to a clarification request by selecting a predefined answer rather than being required to enter a specific answer.  One of the predefined answers must be the "default" answer.

=== Clarification Categories ===

The CCS must be able to configure "categories" to which clarification requests can be assigned from the [[#contest.yaml | contest configuration file]]. A request belongs to exactly one category.  Examples of categories are "General", "SysOps", "Operations".

In addition, the CCS must construct one category per problem, i.e., categories named e.g. "Problem A", "Problem B", etc. for each problem.

=== Programming Languages ===

==== Supported Languages ====

The CCS must provide the ability to compile and execute (or interpret, as appropriate for the language) submitted source code files for each of the languages specified by the [http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/programming-environment Environment of the World Finals].

==== Language Options ====

For each supported language compiler or interpreter it must be possible to configure the CCS to invoke it with any of the options specified in the compiler or interpreter's documentation.

=== Contest Problems ===

Problems (including judge data, validators, execution time limit, etc) are specified and configured using the [http://www.problemarchive.org/wiki/index.php/Problem_Format | Kattis problem package format]. The CCS must support this standard with the following exceptions:

* The CCS does not have to support the use of the following keys in problem.yaml: type, libraries or languages. This means that the default value will be used.
* The CCS does only have to support the values "default" or "custom" for the key validation in problem.yaml.
* The CCS does not have to support sections 5 "Included Code", 9 "Graders" or 10 "Generators".

The CCS must report an error when importing problems that use any unsupported features. The CCS may report an error when unsupported keys are used, even if they are given the default value.

The problem name is as defined in the ''problemname'' macro in the problem specification. Optionally, the ''plainproblemname'', if present, may be used instead. If ''problemname'' is used then escaped parts of it must be handled properly. If ''plainproblemname'' is used it must be used verbatim.

=== Configuration Change ===

The CCS must allow updating of configuration data without restarting or stopping the CCS.  

The CCS must support the ability to create and save an updated contest.yaml file upon request.

== Admin Interface ==

This section describes all the required capabilities for users authenticated as admin.

=== Account Disabling ===

The CCS must have a mechanism to disable any account (either an account for a human user or for another system), without the need for starting or stopping the contest. For example, this includes [[#Secure_Authentication|team accounts]] and judge accounts.

=== Changes To Authentication Data ===

The CCS must allow user authentication credential information to be changed dynamically by contest administration staff while the contest is running.

=== Starting the Contest ===

The contest must automatically start when the configured start time is reached. It must also be possible to start the contest at the current time.

=== Adjusting for Exceptional Circumstances ===

==== Removing time intervals ====

It must be possible to, potentially retroactively, specify time intervals that will be disregarded for the purpose of scoring. The time during all such intervals will not be counted towards a team's penalty time for solved problems. Beginning and end of time intervals are given in wall-clock time.

Note that removing a time interval changes the wall-clock time when the contest ends, as the duration of the contest in [[#contest.yaml|contest.yaml]] is specified in contest time. 

Removing the interval between time T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>, where T<sub>0</sub> &le; T<sub>1</sub>, means that all submissions received between T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> will have the same contest time and that the time for all submissions received after T<sub>1</sub> will have a contest time that is T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0</sub> lower than if the interval was not removed.

The removal of a time interval must be reversible.  This means that if a time interval is removed, the CCS must support the capability of subsequently restoring the contest to the state it had prior to the removal of the time interval. 

Note that time interval removal does not affect the order in which submissions arrived to the CCS. If submission S<sub>i</sub> arrived before submission S<sub>j</sub> during a removed interval, S<sub>i</sub> must still be considered by the CCS to have arrived strictly before S<sub>j</sub>.

==== Changing contest length ====

It must be possible to change the length of the contest at any time during the contest.

==== Adding penalty time ====

It must be possible to specify, for each team, an integer, potentially negative, amount of penalty time to be added into that team's total penalty time.

=== Pausing Judging ===

The CCS must provide some way to temporarily pause judging on a per problem basis. While judging is paused teams should still be able to make submissions and these submission should be shown on the scoreboard as usual.

=== Rejudging === 

==== Automatic Rejudging ====

The CCS must allow the ability to automatically rejudge a selected set of submissions.

Each submission in the set of selected submissions is executed and judged in the same manner as for a newly arrived submission.

==== Previewing Rejudgement Results ====

There must be a way to preview the judgements which result from rejudging the set of selected submissions without committing the resulting judgements.

==== Submission Selection ==== 

The CCS must provide the ability to specify a filter defining the set of submissions to be rejudged.
The CCS must support any combination of filters of the following types:

# A specific (single) submission.
# All submissions for a specific problem.
# All submissions using a specific language.
# All submissions by a specific team or set of teams.
# All submissions between some contest time T<sub>0</sub> and some subsequent contest time T<sub>1</sub>.
# All submissions which have been assigned any specific one of the allowable submission judgments as defined in [[#Judge Responses|Judge Responses]], or all submissions that received any judgment other than "Accepted" (that is, all rejected submissions).
# All submissions which have been run on a specific computer (identified in some reasonable way, e.g., IP address or hostname).  This requirement is only applicable if the CCS uses multiple machines to run submissions.

Thus, for example, it must be possible to select "all rejected submissions for problem B", "all Time Limit Exceeded submissions using Java for problem C", "all submissions from the first hour of the contest using Java", or "all submissions using C++".

=== Manual Override of Judgments ===

The CCS must support the ability to assign, to a single submission, an updated judgment chosen from among any of the allowed submission judgments as defined in [[Contest_Control_System#Judge Responses|Judge Responses]], or else to delete the submission. Deleted submissions must have no effect on scoring.

The CCS must require a separate authentication every time a judgment is changed manually and all such changes must be logged.

=== Scoreboard Display ===

The CCS must provide a mechanism for judges to view the current scoreboard. The scoreboard must be updated at least every 30 seconds.

During times when the scoreboard is frozen, administrators must be able to view the current (updated) scoreboard as well as the frozen scoreboard.

=== Freezing the Scoreboard ===

The scoreboard must automatically freeze when the configured scoreboard freeze time is reached. It must also be possible to manually freeze the scoreboard at the current time. All submissions received after the freeze time must be treated as pending on a frozen scoreboard.

The exact phrase displayed on the frozen scoreboard must be:

  The scoreboard was frozen with XX minutes remaining - submissions in the last XX minutes of the contest are still shown as pending.

where XX is the number of minutes remaining in the contest at the time the scoreboard was frozen.

It must be possible to re-enable scoreboard display updating at any time after it has been disabled, again without stopping the contest or affecting contest operations in any way.

=== Finalizing the Contest ===

Finalizing is the procedure to authorize the final results at the end of a contest.  The [[#results.tsv|results.tsv]] and [[#scoreboard.tsv|scoreboard.tsv]] files will be generated and the [[Event_Feed#Finalized_Event|finalized]] element will be sent on the [[Event Feed]]s.

When the contest is over, but not finalized, all scoreboards must show a warning that the results are not final.

The CCS must provide a way for admins to finalize the contest. It must ''not'' be possible to finalize a contest if one or more of the following applies:

# The contest is still running (i.e., the contest is not over).
# There are un-judged submissions.
# There are submissions judged as [[#Exception Judgments|Judging Error]].
# There are unanswered clarification requests.

The following fields need to be entered before Finalizing the contest:
# B, a non-negative integer, as used in [[#Scoring Data Generation|Scoring Data Generation]].
# a comment, string, that indicates who approves the Final Results, for Example Finalized by John Doe and Jane Doe.

== Team Interface ==

This section describes all the required capabilities for users authenticated as team.

=== Submissions ===

For purposes of this standard, solutions to problems submitted for judging are called '''submissions'''.
A submission consists of a set of source code files sent as a single unit at one time to the judging system by a team.

==== Submission Mechanism ====

The CCS must provide each team with the ability to make a submission to the judging system.

==== Submission Contents ====

A team must be able to specify, for each submission: 
# the contest problem to which the submission applies;
# the programming language used in the submission; 
# the source code file or files comprising the submission. 

The CCS must allow teams to specify at least 10 files in a given submission and must allow teams to make submissions for any defined contest problem, written in any defined contest programming language.

==== Team Viewing of Submission Status ====

The CCS must provide each team with a capability for reviewing the status of each submission the team has made, including: the contest time of the submission, the language and problem specified in the submission; and the most recent judgment (if any) for the submission.

==== Submission Security ====

The CCS must ensure that no team can learn anything about the submissions of any other team (other than what can be deduced from the scoreboard).

=== Clarification Requests ===

A clarification request is a message sent from a team to the judges asking for clarification regarding a contest problem or possibly the contest in general.

==== Sending Clarification Requests ====

The CCS must provide each team with the ability to submit a clarification request to the judges over the network. 

==== Content of Clarification Requests ====

The team must be able to specify the text content and category of a clarification request.

==== Viewing of Clarification Request Status ====

The CCS must provide each team with a capability for reviewing the status of each clarification request the team has submitted, including: the contest time of the clarification request; the problem identified in the clarification request if identification of a specific problem was required by the CCS; and the response from the judges to the clarification request if any response has occurred yet.

==== Clarification Request Security ====

The CCS must ensure that no team can see the clarification requests of any other team, except as provided in the section [[Contest_Control_System#Judge_Interface | Judge Interface]].

=== Broadcast Messages ===

==== Team Viewing of Broadcast Messages ====

The CCS must provide each team with a capability for viewing any broadcast messages sent by the judges (see [[Contest_Control_System#Issuing_Broadcast_Messages| Issuing Broadcast Messages]] under Judging).

=== Notifications ===

The CCS must notify teams when a judgement, clarification or broadcast message has been received. This notification may not steal focus.

=== Scoreboard Display ===

The CCS must provide a mechanism for teams to view the current scoreboard. The scoreboard must be updated at least every 30 seconds.

== Judge Interface ==

This section describes all the required capabilities for users authenticated as judge.

=== Simultaneous Usage ===

It must be possible for multiple human judges, working on different computers, to simultaneously perform the operations specified in this subsection (on different submissions).

=== Viewing Submissions ===

The CCS must provide a human judge with the ability to perform each of the following operations:

# See a list of all submissions, where the list includes (for each submission) the contest-relative time at which the submission was sent, the problem and language specified in the submission, and any judgments applied.
# Sort the list of submissions by submission time (newest submissions first).
# Filter the list of submissions by:
## Problem
## Team
## Language
## Judgement applied.
# View and download the output produced by the submission when run against the specified input data. 
# View and download the source code contained in any specific submission.
# View the compiler output resulting from compiling any specific submission using the compiler arguments configured in the CCS.
# View the validator output resulting from invoking the external validator associated with the contest problem for any specific submission.
# View and download the judge's input data file associated with the contest problem for any specific submission.
# View and download the "judge's output" (the "correct answer" file) associated with the contest problem for any specific submission.
# View the judge data description, if available.
# View a diff between team output for the submission and judge answer file for the problem.
# View previous submissions by the same team on the same problem.

In addition, any additional analytical capabilities allowing the judges to track differences between submissions are appreciated.

=== Handling Clarifications Requests ===

The CCS must provide a human judge with the ability to perform each of the following operations:

# See a list of all clarification requests, where the list includes (for each clar) the team which submitted the request, the contest-relative time at which the clar was submitted, and an indication of whether or not an answer to the clar has been sent to the team which submitted it.
# Sort the list of clarification requests by time.
# Filter the list of clarification requests by: 
## A user-specified set of [[#Clarification Categories|categories]]
## A team
## Whether the clarification request has been answered.
# Determine, for any specific clarification request, what answer was returned to the team if the clar has already been answered.
# Compose an answer to the clar and send it, along with the text of the original clarification request, to the team.
# Optionally choose to also send the clarification request text and answer to all teams in the contest.
# Change the category of a clarification request.

=== Issuing Broadcast Messages ===

The CCS must provide the ability for a human judge to compose a message and broadcast that message to all teams in the contest. It must be possible to do this even when the contest is not running.

=== Scoreboard Display ===

The CCS must provide a mechanism for judges to view the current scoreboard. The scoreboard must be updated at least every 30 seconds.

During times when the scoreboard is frozen, judges must be able to view the current (updated) scoreboard as well as the frozen scoreboard.

== Judging ==

=== Automated Judgements ===

The CCS must be able to automatically judge incoming submissions. This mechanism must automatically (that is, without human intervention) process each incoming submissions, and for each such submission must automatically:

# Compile (if appropriate for the language) the program contained in the submission, enforcing the [[Problem_format#limits|compilation time limit]].
# Execute the program contained in the submission, with the corresponding contest problem data automatically supplied to the program.
# Prevent the submitted program from performing any [[#Prohibited_Operations|prohibited operations]].
# Enforce any configured [[Problem_format#limits|execution time limit]], [[Problem_format#limits|memory limit]], and [[Problem_format#limits|output size limit]] specified for the corresponding problem.
#* The execution time limit gives a restriction on the amount of ''CPU time'' that the submission may consume, per test file.
#* In addition, the CCS must restrict the submission to use a ''wall time'' that is at most twice the execution time limit (to safeguard against submissions which spend a long time without using CPU time by e.g., sleeping).
# Invoke an external program, known for purposes of this standard as a [[#External Validators|validator]], passing to it the output generated by the program specified in the submission and getting back from it an indication of what judgment is to be applied to the submission (see the [[#External Validators|External Validators]] section).
# Assign an [[#Judge_Responses|appropriate judgment]] to the run.
# Send a notification about the judgement to the team.

It must be possible to configure the CCS such that these actions are performed on a machine that is not accessible to any team (possibly just a different virtual machine, e.g. if the machines used in the contest are thin clients connecting to a shared server).

=== Prevention of Auto-judge Machine Starvation ===
The CCS must use auto-judge machines efficiently and fairly. At a minimum it needs to ensure:
#Submissions must not be left in queue if there are unused auto-judge machines.
#The system must prevent a single team from starving other teams out of auto-judge machines.

=== Prohibited Operations ===

The CCS must ensure that prohibited operations in submissions have no non-trivial outside effects.

The prohibited operations are:
# Using libraries except those explicitly allowed
# Executing other programs
# Creating new processes
# Creating new threads
# Reading any files
# Creating files
# Sending signals to other programs
# Side-stepping time or memory limits
# Sending or receiving network traffic, e.g. opening sockets

=== Judge Responses ===

The CCS must answer each submission with one of the following responses:

{| class="wikitable"
! Response
! Acronym
|-
| Compile Error  || CE
|-
| Run-Time Error  || RTE
|-
| Time Limit Exceeded  || TLE
|-
| Wrong Answer  || WA
|-
| Accepted  || AC
|-
| Security Violation  || SV
|-
| Judging Error  || JE
|-
|}

=== Assigning a Judgment ===

The next two sections define how to assign a judgment to a submission for problems with a single input file and with multiple input files, respectively.  Note however that the '''Judging Error''' and '''Security Violation''' judgments constitute exceptions to this, as defined in [[#Exceptional Judgments|Exceptional Judgments]].

==== Judging With a Single Input File ====

To determine which answer to use, the following rules must be applied in order:

# If the submitted program fails to compile or compilation exceeds the [[Problem_format#limits|compilation time limit]], the response must be '''Compile Error'''.
# If the submitted program exceeds the [[Problem_format#limits|memory limit]] or crashes before the [[Problem_format#limits|execution time limit]] is exceeded, the answer must be '''Run-Time Error'''.
# If the submitted program runs longer than the [[Problem_format#limits|execution time limit]], the answer must be '''Time Limit Exceeded'''.
# If the output of the submitted program exceeds the [[Problem_format#limits|output size limit]] or if the output of the submitted program is not accepted by the output validator, the answer must be '''Wrong Answer'''.
# If the output of the submitted program is accepted by the output validator, the answer must be '''Accepted'''.

==== Judging With Multiple Input Files ====

If the problem has multiple judge input files the judgment is assigned as follows:

# For each input file apply the [[#Judging With a Single Input File|decision process for a single input file]].
# If any file is not judged as '''Accepted''', the response must be that of the first file, in alphabetical order, that was not judged '''Accepted'''.
# Otherwise the response must be '''Accepted'''.

Note that the CCS is only required to judge as many files as needed to determine the first file, if any, that is not judged '''Accepted'''.

==== Exceptional Judgments ====

The preceding sections define how to assign a judgment to a submitted program.  However, the following two exceptions apply:

# If, during any point of the judging process an error occurs that the CCS can not recover from, '''Judging Error''' must be the judgment.
# If, during any point of the judging process the submitted program tries to perform a [[#Prohibited_Operations|prohibited operation]], '''Security Violation''' may be the judgment.

=== Validators ===

A CCS supporting this standard must safeguard against faulty validators. For instance, if a validator were to produce excessively large feedback files, or crash, the CCS must handle this gracefully and report it to contest staff. Reasons for such misbehaviour of the validator program could be for instance a security bug in the validator program, enabling malicious submissions to produce feedback files of their own choosing.

The content of ''stdout'' and ''stderr'' of the output validator can be ignored by the contest control system.

== Scoring ==

=== Scoring Data Generation ===

The CCS must be capable of automatically generating up-to-date scoring data according to the following:

# For purposes of scoring, the ''contest time of a submission'' is the number of minutes elapsed from the beginning of the contest when the submission was made, skipping removed time intervals if specified (see [[#Removing_time_intervals|Removing Time Intervals]]).  This is rounded ''down'' to the nearest minute, so 59.99 seconds is 0 minutes.
# The ''contest time that a team solved a problem'' is the contest time of the team's first accepted submission to that problem.
# A team's ''penalty time on a problem'' is the contest time that the team solved the problem, plus ''penaltytime'' (from [[#contest.yaml|contest.yaml]]) minutes for each previous rejected run by that team on that problem, or 0 if the team has not solved the problem.
# A team's ''total penalty time'' is the sum of the penalty times for all problems plus any judge added penalty time.
# A team's ''last accepted submission'' is the contest time of the problem that the team solved last.
# The ''position'' of a team is determined by sorting the teams first by number of problems solved (descending), then within that by total penalty time (ascending), then within that by last accepted submission (ascending).
# The ''rank'' of a team is then determined as follows:
## For teams in positions up to and including 12+B, the rank equals the position (B is provided when [[#Finalizing_the_Contest|finalizing the contest]]; the default value is 0).
## Teams that solved fewer problems than the median team are not ranked at all.
## For the remaining teams, the rank is determined by sorting the teams by number of problems solved (descending).
# The ''award'' of a team is:
## ''gold'' if rank is 1 through 4.
## ''silver'' if rank is 5 through 8.
## ''bronze'' if rank is 9 through 12+B.
## ''ranked'' if rank is not 1 through 12+B but the team is ranked.
## ''honorable'' otherwise.

When a number of teams are tied for the same position/rank, they all occupy the same position/rank and a suitable number of subsequent positions/ranks are left empty.  For instance, if four teams are tied for 17th position, they are all in 17th position and positions 18, 19 and 20 are unoccupied.

A submission is pending judgement if it has no judgement or if the judgement is '''Judging Error'''.  Pending judgements have no effect on scoring.

=== Scoreboard ===

The ''current scoreboard'' lists the teams sorted by position (with alphabetical order on university name as tie breaker).  

The scoreboard must include at least the following information.

For each team:
# university name
# univerisity logo (see [[#logos.tar.gz|logos.tar.gz]])
# team position
# number of problems solved
# total penalty time

For each team and problem:
# number of submissions from that team on that problem,
# whether the problem is solved, unsolved or a judgement is pending,
# if the problem is solved, the contest time at which it was solved,
# if the problem is pending judgement, how many submissions are pending judgement on that problem,

A problem is pending judgement if any submission on it is pending judgement and there is not an earlier accepted submission on that problem.

== Data Export ==

=== Event Feed ===

It is a requirement that the CCS provide an ''external event feed''.  This means that the CCS must have a mechanism for external processes to connect to the CCS and obtain dynamic real-time updates regarding the current state of the contest. The CCS event feed mechanism must comply with the [[Event Feed|Event Feed specification]].

=== Scoreboard Data File ===

The CCS must be capable of generating an external file containing the current scoreboard. The format of this file must be as defined in [[#scoreboard.tsv|scoreboard.tsv]].

The CCS must automatically save an updated copy of the external scoring data file whenever the scoring data itself is updated as described above.

=== Final Results Data File ===

The ''final results'' lists the ranked teams sorted by rank (with alphabetical order on team name as tie breaker), followed by the unranked teams (sorted alphabetically by team name).  It includes for each ranked team their rank and:
# The number of problems solved, if the team is ranked (i.e., if they solved more than the median number of problems).
# The total penalty time and time of last accepted submission, if the team is in rank 1 through 12+B (where B is as defined in [[#Scoring_Data_Generation|Scoring Data Generation]]). 

The CCS must be capable of generating an external file containing the final results of the World Finals contest. The format of this file must be as defined in the [[#results.tsv|results.tsv]].

== Documentation Requirements ==

=== Items Which Must Be Submitted ===

In order for a given CCS to be considered as a candidate for running the ICPC World Finals contest, a single archive file (e.g. .zip, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz) must be submitted to the World Finals Director of Operations. The archive file must contain all of the following items:

# The complete set of files, modules, or packages making up the executable components of the CCS.
# PDF's for each of the documents listed under [[Contest_Control_System#Documentation_Requirements| Documentation Requirements]].
# A text file named "License" containing the license, conforming to the the [[#Licensing|Licensing]] section, under which the CCS is made available to the ACM ICPC.
# A text file named "readme" containing instructions on how to properly unpack the archive file to set up the installation process.

=== Standard Compliance ===

The CCS must include a ''Standard Compliance'' document in PDF format, that for each requirement (referencing by requirement number) in this standard document confirms that the CCS conforms and explains how the functionality is implemented.

=== Team Guide ===

The CCS must include a "Team Guide" document in PDF format. The Team Guide must provide all the necessary instructions showing how a contest team uses the functions of the team interface.

The Team Guide must also describe the way in which judge's responses to submissions and clarification requests are received by teams.

=== Judge's Guide ===

The CCS must include a "Judge's Guide" document in PDF format. The Judge's Guide must provide all the necessary instructions showing how a human contest judge uses the functions of the human judge interface.

=== Contest Administrator's Guide ===

The CCS must include a "Contest Administrator's Guide" document in PDF format. The Administrator's Guide must provide all the necessary instructions showing how contest personnel use the functions of the CCS to set up and manage a contest.

In the event that a configuration item is provided by using services of the underlying operating system rather than facilities directly implemented or controlled by the CCS itself, the administrator's Guide must explicitly state this fact, and reference the System Manager's Guide (see below) as the source of information on handling that portion of configuration and preparation for the contest.

=== System Manager's Guide ===

The CCS must include a "System Manager's Guide" document in PDF format. The System Manager's Guide must describe the steps required to install and start the CCS on the OS platform specified for use in the World Finals. In the event that the CCS consists of multiple modules and/or packages, the guide must contain a description of the relationship between the modules or packages, including any specific installation and/or startup steps required for each module or package.

The System Manager's Guide must provide instructions to contest personnel explaining situations (if any) where the CCS uses functions of the underlying operating system (OS) platform to meet requirements laid out in this standard. For example, if the CCS relies on the use of OS account and password management to implement requirements related to contest security and credentials, or print services provided by the OS to implement requirements related to external notifications, this must be described in the System Manager's Guide.

The System Manager's Guide must explicitly list any operating system dependencies of the CCS, including but not limited to which OS platform and version are required and which optional OS packages must be installed for the CCS to function properly.

The System Manager's Guide must explicitly list any software dependencies of the CCS. For example, any tools such as Java, PERL, WebServer, Browser, database systems, etc., which are required for correct operation of the CCS must be listed in the guide, including specific version numbers of each tool which the CCS requires for its correct operation.

The System Manager's Guide must describe the steps required to use each of the "Testability Interfaces" described in the section on Testability. For example, the guide must describe how to invoke the command-line tool which supports submitting runs from a team, as well as describing the use of all other required testability interfaces.

== Appendix: File formats ==

All files must be encoded in UTF-8.

=== Input files ===

==== contest.yaml ====

A YAML file consisting of a mapping with the following keys:
 
{| class="wikitable"

A CCS may place reasonable requirements on the configuration of languages. For instance, a CCS may require that the C compiler is configured such that the output binary will be statically linked and output a binary with name 'long_weird_name'. Such requirements should be clearly specified in the CCS documentation. The CCS should not place any restrictions on optimization options used, and should in general place as few restrictions as possible on the language configuration.
