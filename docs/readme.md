# Contest Control System (CCS) Specifications

This site contains multiple versions of the CCS specification. Each version of the specification contains a set of related specs for interoperability between different contest control systems and the tools that interact with them. These specifications have been designed and used in the context of the [ICPC World Finals](https://icpc.global) and various (sub)regionals, but they are meant to be useful outside the ICPC context as well.

Select a version to browse from the left navigation bar.
For the current stable release (2022-07), go [here](https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/2022-07).

Draft work on the next (future) version of the spec is done on the `master` branch in the
repository and can be viewed [here](https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/draft).
These drafts can change in any way at any time.

### Stable/Released Versions

Once a specification is released it uses the naming scheme `<yyyy>-<mm>`.
These releases are stable and will not change except for trivial changes such
as fixing spelling and grammar, or improving examples or explanations.
