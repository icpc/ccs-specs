The document\ndefines a set of operations, capabilities, and features which any\ncandidate system must provide, including a set of testability criteria\nwhich must be satisfied and a set of documentation which must be\nprovided.</p>\n<p>The current draft of the requirements document is <em>Version 1.0</em>,\npublished <em><insert publication date></em> by the <em>Competitive Learning\nInstitute</em> (<em><insert CLI website URL></em>). [TODO: insert into the\nprevious sentence the final publication date once the requirements has\nbeen approved; insert official CLI website URL once that has been\ncreated.]</p>\n<p>The primary authors of the document are John Clevenger and Fredrik\nNiemelä, acting under the auspices of the Competitive Learning Institute\n(CLI). Contributors to the document include Samir Ashoo, Per Austrin,\nTroy Boudreau, Tim deBoer, Emma Enström, Mikael Goldman, Gunnar Kreitz,\nDoug Lane, Pehr Söderman, and Mattias de Zalenski.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>For purposes of this requirements document, the term <em>contest control\nsystem</em> (CCS) means software which automatically manages the operation\nof a programming contest. Operations to be managed by the CCS include:\nrunning submissions by teams, judging of submissions, handling\nclarification requests from teams and clarification responses from\njudges, calculation of standings, generating external representations of\ncontest results, and overall CCS configuration.</p>\n<p>A contest control system may be submitted to the Director of Operations\nfor the ICPC World Finals for consideration as a candidate to run the\nWorld Finals. The items which must be submitted in order to be\nconsidered are described under <a href=\"#documentation-requirements\">Documentation\nRequirements</a> in this document. Any\nsubmitted CCS which meets all of the requirements defined in this\ndocument will be certified as being accepted as a candidate to run the\nWorld Finals. Meeting or failing to meet each requirement will be\ndetermined by a test specified by the Director of Operations and/or\nhis/her designee.</p>\n<p>The choice of the CCS actually used to run the World Finals each year\nwill be made by the Director of Operations from among those CCSs which\nhave been accepted as candidates prior to the acceptance deadline.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rationale\">Rationale</h3>\n<p>This document is intended to specify functional requirements, not\nimplementation requirements. Nothing in this document should be\nconstrued as requiring any particular implementation architecture or use\nof any particular implementation language or languages. For example, a\nCCS might be implemented as a set of stand-alone applications using a\nclient-server architecture, or might equally well be implemented as a\nset of scripts, web pages, and/or other facilities.</p>\n<p>These requirements are not intended to act as a specification for what\nconstitutes “best practices” in a Contest Control System; rather, it\nacts solely as a specification of what functionality is required to be a\ncandidate for running the ICPC World Finals. As such, there may be\nfunctions listed in this document which are specific solely to the ICPC\nWorld Finals but might not be required for running other contests; a\ncandidate CCS must meet the requirements for these functions.</p>\n<p>Likewise, there may be functionality which a CCS provides to meet the\nrequirements of some other contest; such additional functionality will\nnot disqualify the CCS from qualifying as a candidate to run the ICPC\nWorld Finals provided the CCS meets all the requirements listed in this\ndocument.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-requirements\">General Requirements</h2>\n<h3 id=\"licensing\">Licensing</h3>\n<p>The CCS must either be freely usable, or must be accompanied by a\nlicense granting to the ICPC the non-exclusive, non-revocable,\nnon-transferable rights of use of the CCS both for purposes of\nevaluation and testing and for use in the ICPC World Finals. The CCS may\nnot require obtaining any third-party license in order to be used by the\nICPC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-persistency\">Data Persistency</h3>\n<h4 id=\"contest-configuration-persistency\">Contest Configuration Persistency</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support persistence of the contest configuration. This\nmeans that following a shutdown of the CCS, or a failure on the\nmachine(s) on which the CCS runs, it must be possible to quickly restore\nthe configuration information already entered into the CCS without the\nnecessity of reentering that configuration data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contest-state-persistency\">Contest State Persistency</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support persistence of the contest state once the contest\nhas been started. This means that following a shutdown of the CCS, a\npower or hardware failure on the machine(s) on which the CCS runs, it\nmust be possible to quickly restore the contest state to what it was\nprior to the disruption. The contest state for purposes of this\nrequirement includes all data regarding team submissions, clarification\nrequests, clarifications, judgements, and similar data defining and/or\naffecting the standings of the contest.</p>\n<p>The CCS must not lose more than 1 minute of contest data on a failure of\nany part of the contest system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"account-types\">Account Types</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability of clients to access the system through\ndifferent <em>account types</em>.</p>\n<p>The type of account which a client uses to access the system constrains\nthe functions which the client may perform, as described below.</p>\n<p>At least the following different types of accounts must be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Team: used by teams competing in the contest. The functions\navailable to team clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#team-interface\">team\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Judge: used by judges in the contest. The functions available to\njudge clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#judge-interface\">judge\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Admin: used by contest administrators. The functions available to\nadmin clients are as defined in the section on the <a href=\"#admin-interface\">admin\ninterface</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"secure-authentication\">Secure Authentication</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support a secure authentication mechanism, allowing each\nregistered user (being either a <a href=\"#team-interface\">team</a>, an\n<a href=\"#admin-interface\">admin</a>, or a\n<a href=\"#judge-interface\">judge</a>) to gain access to the contest, and\nmust ensure that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only users who supply correct authentication credentials may invoke\ncontest-related functions.</li>\n<li>Users may only invoke functions corresponding to their\nauthentication credentials. (In other words, it must not be possible\nfor, e.g., a team to invoke functions as if they were some other\nteam, or as if they were a judge.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The CCS may rely on the underlying operating system account\nlogin/password mechanism for purposes of meeting the requirements of\nthis section, provided that it is the case that the CCS enforces all of\nthe requirements of this section, including but not limited to the\nrequirement that users not be allowed to invoke functions as if they\nwere some user other than that specified by their login credentials.</p>\n<h4 id=\"authentication-data\">Authentication Data</h4>\n<p>If the CCS uses a login/password mechanism to enforce secure\nauthentication, it must support account creation and password assignment\naccording to the following algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>read <a href=\"#teamstsv\">teams.tsv</a> defining team accounts to be\ncreated</li>\n<li>read <a href=\"#accountstsv\">accounts.tsv</a> defining additional\naccounts to be created or, for teams, specifying the password of the\naccounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"logging-out\">Logging Out</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support a mechanism for each user to disconnect from the\ncontest, with the effect that no other user of the computer system not\npossessing that team’s authentication credentials will be able to invoke\nCCS functions as if they did possess those credentials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"network-security\">Network Security</h3>\n<p>All communication between CCS modules which takes place over the contest\nnetwork must be encrypted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-outside-contact\">No outside contact</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to run at the World Finals site without contact to\nanything outside the contest network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"timestamps-and-ids\">Timestamps and IDs</h3>\n<p>A timestamp and an integer sequence, called an ID, are assigned to\nsubmissions and clarification requests at the time they enter the\nsystem. The following constraints must be enforced by the CCS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submissions received earlier must have a lower ID than submissions\nreceived later. The same holds for the IDs of clarification\nrequests.</li>\n<li>Timestamps must have at least second granularity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"limitations\">Limitations</h3>\n<h4 id=\"number-of-problems\">Number of Problems</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 15 problems. Specifically any UI,\nscoreboards or other reports should be fully usable with that number of\nproblems.</p>\n<h4 id=\"number-of-teams\">Number of Teams</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 200 teams.</p>\n<h4 id=\"test-data-files\">Test Data Files</h4>\n<p>The CCS must support at least 200 test data files per problem, a maximum\nsize of 8GB per test data file and a combined size for all test data\nfiles in a problem of 20GB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-at-the-world-finals\">Use At The World Finals</h3>\n<p>In order for a CCS to be selected for use at the World Finals the\nfollowing constraints must be satisfied:</p>\n<h4 id=\"support-personnel\">Support Personnel</h4>\n<p>At least one person from the submitting entity with intimate knowledge\nabout the inner workings of the CCS must be willing and able to attend\nat the World Finals where it is used.</p>\n<h4 id=\"computer-platform\">Computer Platform</h4>\n<p>The CCS must run on the computer platform set aside for the CCS at the\nWorld Finals and posted at the ICPC web site. Normally this will consist\nof one machine per team, several auto-judging machines that are\nidentical to the team machines, and one or more servers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contest-configuration\">Contest Configuration</h2>\n<h3 id=\"advance-configuration\">Advance Configuration</h3>\n<p>All variable aspects of the CCS must be configurable prior to the start\nof a World Finals contest. That is, the CCS may not require that any\nchanges be made to the CCS configuration once the contest has started.\nNote that this does not alter any requirements which state that the CCS\nmust allow certain configuration changes to be able to be made after the\ncontest starts; it means that the contest administration staff must not\nbe required to make any changes once the contest starts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"importing-contest-configuration\">Importing Contest Configuration</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to import contest configuration from a single URL,\nand use the data at that location to configure the CCS. The\nconfiguration URL contains all contest configuration data, including the\ncontest configuration file (<a href=\"#contestyaml\">contest.yaml</a>),\nproblemset configuration file\n(<a href=\"#problemsetyaml\">problemset.yaml</a>), problem definitions,\nteams.tsv, groups.tsv and logos.tar.gz. For example, if the URL is\n<a href=\"http://10.1.1.0/data\">http://10.1.1.0/data</a>, teams.tsv can be imported from\n<a href=\"http://10.1.1.0/data/teams.tsv\">http://10.1.1.0/data/teams.tsv</a>.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read <a href=\"#teamstsv\">teams.tsv</a>, which\ncontains a list of teams registered for the World Finals. It must use\nthe data in this file to automatically create whatever internal\nrepresentation is necessary to allow each team (and only the teams)\nspecified in the registration list to participate in the World Finals\ncontest.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read <a href=\"#groupstsv\">groups.tsv</a>, an\ninitialization file containing the list of groups to which the teams\nbelong.</p>\n<p>The CCS must be able to read language configuration from an archive following\nthe <a href=\"https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/contest_archive_format\">Contest Archive Format</a>.\nSee specifically the <a href=\"https://ccs-specs.icpc.io/contest_archive_format#language-object\">language object</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"clock-synchronization\">Clock Synchronization</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be able to synchronize its clock to an NTP server provided\non the contest network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"predefined-clarification-answers\">Predefined Clarification Answers</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support predefined answers to clarification requests, so\nthat judges can choose to reply to a clarification request by selecting\na predefined answer rather than being required to enter a specific\nanswer. At least the following predefined answers must be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No comment, read problem statement.</li>\n<li>This will be answered during the answers to questions session.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"clarification-categories\">Clarification Categories</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support “categories” to which clarification\nrequests can be assigned. A request belongs to exactly one\ncategory. At least the following categories need to be supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General</li>\n<li>SysOps</li>\n<li>Operations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the CCS must construct one category per problem, i.e.,\ncategories named e.g. “Problem A”, “Problem B”, etc. for each problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages\">Programming Languages</h3>\n<h4 id=\"supported-languages\">Supported Languages</h4>\n<p>The CCS must provide the ability to compile and execute (or interpret,\nas appropriate for the language) submitted source code files for each of\nthe languages specified by the <a href=\"https://icpc.global/worldfinals/programming-environment\">Environment of the World\nFinals</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"language-options\">Language Options</h4>\n<p>For each supported language compiler or interpreter it must be possible\nto configure the CCS to invoke it with any of the options specified in\nthe compiler or interpreter’s documentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contest-problems\">Contest Problems</h3>\n<p>Problems (including judge data, validators, execution time limit, etc)\nare specified and configured using the <a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/\">Problem\npackage format</a>. The CCS must support this format\nwith the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CCS does not have to support the use of the following keys in\nproblem.yaml: type, libraries or languages. This means that the\ndefault value will be used.</li>\n<li>The CCS does only have to support the values “default” or “custom”\nfor the key validation in problem.yaml.</li>\n<li>The CCS does not have to support sections 5 “Included Code”, 9\n“Graders” or 10 “Generators”.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-note\">>TODO: Drop the exceptions above?\n</code></pre>  \n<p>The CCS must report an error when importing problems that use any\nunsupported features. The CCS may report an error when unsupported keys\nare used, even if they are given the default value.</p>\n<p>The problem name is as defined in the <em>problemname</em> macro in the problem\nspecification. Optionally, the <em>plainproblemname</em>, if present, may be\nused instead. If <em>problemname</em> is used then escaped parts of it must be\nhandled properly. If <em>plainproblemname</em> is used it must be used\nverbatim.</p>\n<h3 id=\"configuration-change\">Configuration Change</h3>\n<p>The CCS must allow updating of configuration data without restarting or\nstopping the CCS.</p>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability to create and save an updated\ncontest.yaml file upon request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"admin-interface\">Admin Interface</h2>\n<p>This section describes all the required capabilities for users\nauthenticated as admin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"account-disabling\">Account Disabling</h3>\n<p>The CCS must have a mechanism to disable any account (either an account\nfor a human user or for another system), without the need for starting\nor stopping the contest. For example, this includes <a href=\"#secure-authentication\">team\naccounts</a> and judge accounts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"changes-to-authentication-data\">Changes To Authentication Data</h3>\n<p>The CCS must allow user authentication credential information to be\nchanged dynamically by contest administration staff while the contest is\nrunning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"starting-the-contest\">Starting the Contest</h3>\n<p>The contest must automatically start when the configured start time is\nreached. It must also be possible to start the contest at the current\ntime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adjusting-for-exceptional-circumstances\">Adjusting for Exceptional Circumstances</h3>\n<h4 id=\"removing-time-intervals\">Removing time intervals</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to, potentially retroactively, specify time\nintervals that will be disregarded for the purpose of scoring. The time\nduring all such intervals will not be counted towards a team’s penalty\ntime for solved problems. Beginning and end of time intervals are given\nin wall-clock time.</p>\n<p>Note that removing a time interval changes the wall-clock time when the\ncontest ends, as the duration of the contest in\n<a href=\"#contestyaml\">contest.yaml</a> is specified in contest time.</p>\n<p>Removing the interval between time T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>,\nwhere T<sub>0</sub> ≤ T<sub>1</sub>, means that all submissions received\nbetween T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> will have the same contest time\nand that the time for all submissions received after T<sub>1</sub> will\nhave a contest time that is T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>0</sub> lower than if\nthe interval was not removed.</p>\n<p>The removal of a time interval must be reversible. This means that if a\ntime interval is removed, the CCS must support the capability of\nsubsequently restoring the contest to the state it had prior to the\nremoval of the time interval.</p>\n<p>Note that time interval removal does not affect the order in which\nsubmissions arrived to the CCS. If submission S<sub>i</sub> arrived\nbefore submission S<sub>j</sub> during a removed interval, S<sub>i</sub>\nmust still be considered by the CCS to have arrived strictly before\nS<sub>j</sub>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"changing-contest-length\">Changing contest length</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to change the length of the contest at any time\nduring the contest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"adding-penalty-time\">Adding penalty time</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to specify, for each team, an integer, potentially\nnegative, amount of penalty time to be added into that team’s total\npenalty time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ignoring-submissions\">Ignoring submissions</h4>\n<p>It must be possible to remove, ignore or somehow mark a submission so\nthat it in no way affects the scoring of the contest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pausing-judging\">Pausing Judging</h3>\n<p>The CCS must provide some way to temporarily pause judging on a per\nproblem basis. While judging is paused teams should still be able to\nmake submissions and these submission should be shown on the scoreboard\nas usual.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rejudging\">Rejudging</h3>\n<h4 id=\"automatic-rejudging\">Automatic Rejudging</h4>\n<p>The CCS must allow the ability to automatically rejudge a selected set\nof submissions.</p>\n<p>Each submission in the set of selected submissions is executed and\njudged in the same manner as for a newly arrived submission.</p>\n<h4 id=\"previewing-rejudgement-results\">Previewing Rejudgement Results</h4>\n<p>There must be a way to preview the judgements which result from\nrejudging the set of selected submissions without committing the\nresulting judgements.</p>\n<h4 id=\"submission-selection\">Submission Selection</h4>\n<p>The CCS must provide the ability to specify a filter defining the set of\nsubmissions to be rejudged. The CCS must support any combination of\nfilters of the following types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A specific (single) submission.</li>\n<li>All submissions for a specific problem.</li>\n<li>All submissions using a specific language.</li>\n<li>All submissions by a specific team or set of teams.</li>\n<li>All submissions between some time T<sub>0</sub> and some subsequent\ntime T<sub>1</sub>.</li>\n<li>All submissions which have been assigned any specific one of the\nallowable submission judgments as defined in <a href=\"#judge-responses\">Judge\nResponses</a>, or all submissions that\nreceived any judgment other than “Accepted” (that is, all rejected\nsubmissions).</li>\n<li>All submissions which have been run on a specific computer\n(identified in some reasonable way, e.g., IP address or hostname).\nThis requirement is only applicable if the CCS uses multiple\nmachines to run submissions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, for example, it must be possible to select “all rejected\nsubmissions for problem B”, “all Time Limit Exceeded submissions using\nJava for problem C”, “all submissions between time 2013-07-01\n08:00:00+00 and time 2013-07-01 09:00:00+00 of the contest using Java”,\nor “all submissions using C++”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"manual-override-of-judgments\">Manual Override of Judgments</h3>\n<p>The CCS must support the ability to assign, to a single submission, an\nupdated judgment chosen from among any of the allowed submission\njudgments as defined in <a href=\"#judge-responses\">Judge\nResponses</a>.</p>\n<p>The CCS must require a separate authentication every time a judgment is\nchanged manually and all such changes must be logged.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scoreboard-display\">Scoreboard Display</h3>\n<p>The CCS must provide a mechanism for judges to view the current\nscoreboard. The scoreboard must be updated in such a way that it’s never\nmore than 30 seconds out of date.</p>\n<p>During times when the scoreboard is frozen, administrators must be able\nto view the current (updated) scoreboard as well as the frozen\nscoreboard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"freezing-the-scoreboard\">Freezing the Scoreboard</h3>\n<p>The scoreboard must automatically freeze when the configured scoreboard\nfreeze time is reached. It must also be possible to manually freeze the\nscoreboard at the current time. All submissions received after the\nfreeze time must be treated as pending on a frozen scoreboard.</p>\n<p>The exact phrase displayed on the frozen scoreboard must be:</p>\n<p><code>The scoreboard was frozen with XX minutes remaining - submissions in the last XX minutes of the contest are still shown as pending.</code></p>\n<p>where XX is the number of minutes remaining in the contest at the time\nthe scoreboard was frozen.</p>\n<p>It must be possible to re-enable scoreboard display updating at any time\nafter it has been disabled, again without stopping the contest or\naffecting contest operations in any way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finalizing-the-contest\">Finalizing the Contest</h3>\n<p>Finalizing is the procedure to authorize the final results at the end of\na contest. When the contest has been finalized the\n<a href=\"contest_api#contest-state\">contest state</a> endpoint will be updated to\nreflect this.</p>\n<p>When the contest is over, but not finalized, all scoreboards must show a\nwarning that the results are not final.</p>\n<p>The CCS must provide a way for admins to finalize the contest. It must\n<em>not</em> be possible to finalize a contest if one or more of the following\napplies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The contest is still running (i.e., the contest is not over).</li>\n<li>There are un-judged submissions.</li>\n<li>There are submissions judged as\n<a href=\"#exceptional-judgments\">Judging Error</a>.</li>\n<li>There are unanswered clarification requests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before finalizing the contest the value B, as used in\n<a href=\"#scoring-data-generation\">Scoring Data Generation</a> will be provided.\nThe default value for B must be 0.</p>\n<p>If, after providing the correct and final value of B, the\n<a href=\"contest_api#scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> and <a href=\"contest_api#awards\">Awards</a>\nendpoints contain the correct results, the admin may Finalize the\ncontest. These endpoints must be compared with the ones exposed by the\n<a href=\"#shadow-mode\">Shadow CCS</a> and should also be manually sanity checked\nbefore Finalizing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"team-interface\">Team Interface</h2>\n<p>This section describes all the required capabilities for users\nauthenticated as team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submissions\">Submissions</h3>\n<p>For purposes of this document, solutions to problems submitted for\njudging are called <strong>submissions</strong>.

Note however that the <strong>Judging Error</strong> and <strong>Security\nViolation</strong> judgments constitute exceptions to this, as defined in\n<a href=\"#exceptional-judgments\">Exceptional Judgments</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"judging-with-a-single-input-file\">Judging With a Single Input File</h4>\n<p>To determine which answer to use, the following rules must be applied in\norder:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the submitted program fails to compile or compilation exceeds the\n<a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/problem_package_format#limits\">compilation time limit</a>, the\nresponse must be <strong>Compile Error</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the submitted program exceeds the <a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/problem_package_format#limits\">memory\nlimit</a> or crashes before the\n<a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/problem_package_format#limits\">execution time limit</a> is\nexceeded, the answer must be <strong>Run-Time Error</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the submitted program runs longer than the <a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/problem_package_format#limits\">execution time\nlimit</a>, the answer must be <strong>Time\nLimit Exceeded</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the output of the submitted program exceeds the <a href=\"https://icpc.io/problem-package-format/spec/problem_package_format#limits\">output size\nlimit</a> or if the output of the\nsubmitted program is not accepted by the output validator, the\nanswer must be <strong>Wrong Answer</strong>.</li>\n<li>If the output of the submitted program is accepted by the output\nvalidator, the answer must be <strong>Accepted</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"judging-with-multiple-input-files\">Judging With Multiple Input Files</h4>\n<p>If the problem has multiple judge input files the judgment is assigned\nas follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For each input file apply the <a href=\"#judging-with-a-single-input-file\">decision process for a single input\nfile</a>.</li>\n<li>If any file is not judged as <strong>Accepted</strong>, the response must be that\nof the first file, in alphabetical order, that was not judged\n<strong>Accepted</strong>.</li>\n<li>Otherwise the response must be <strong>Accepted</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the CCS is only required to judge as many files as needed to\ndetermine the first file, if any, that is not judged <strong>Accepted</strong>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"exceptional-judgments\">Exceptional Judgments</h4>\n<p>The preceding sections define how to assign a judgment to a submitted\nprogram. However, the following two exceptions apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If, during any point of the judging process an error occurs that the\nCCS can not recover from, <strong>Judging Error</strong> must be the judgment.</li>\n<li>If, during any point of the judging process the submitted program\ntries to perform a <a href=\"#prohibited-operations\">prohibited\noperation</a>, <strong>Security\nViolation</strong> may be the judgment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"validators\">Validators</h3>\n<p>A CCS fulfilling these requirements must safeguard against faulty\nvalidators. For instance, if a validator were to produce excessively\nlarge feedback files, or crash, the CCS must handle this gracefully and\nreport it to contest staff. Reasons for such misbehaviour of the\nvalidator program could be for instance a security bug in the validator\nprogram, enabling malicious submissions to produce feedback files of\ntheir own choosing.</p>\n<p>The content of <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em> of the output validator can be\nignored by the contest control system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scoring\">Scoring</h2>\n<h3 id=\"scoring-data-generation\">Scoring Data Generation</h3>\n<p>The CCS must be capable of automatically generating up-to-date scoring\ndata according to the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For purposes of scoring, the <em>contest time of a submission</em> is the\nnumber of minutes elapsed from the beginning of the contest when the\nsubmission was made, skipping removed time intervals if specified\n(see <a href=\"#removing-time-intervals\">Removing Time\nIntervals</a>). This is rounded\n<em>down</em> to the nearest minute, so 59.99 seconds is 0 minutes.</li>\n<li>The <em>contest time that a team solved a problem</em> is the contest time\nof the team’s first accepted submission to that problem.</li>\n<li>A team’s <em>penalty time on a problem</em> is the contest time that the\nteam solved the problem, plus <em>penaltytime</em> (from\n<a href=\"#contestyaml\">contest.yaml</a>) minutes for each previous\nsubmission rejected with a judgement that causes penalty time, by\nthat team on that problem, or 0 if the team has not solved the\nproblem.</li>\n<li>A team’s <em>total penalty time</em> is the sum of the penalty times for\nall problems plus any judge added penalty time.</li>\n<li>A team’s <em>last accepted submission</em> is the contest time of the\nproblem that the team solved last.</li>\n<li>The <em>position</em> of a team is determined by sorting the teams first by\nnumber of problems solved (descending), then within that by total\npenalty time (ascending), then within that by last accepted\nsubmission (ascending).</li>\n<li>The <em>rank</em> of a team is then determined as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>For teams in positions up to and including 12+B, the rank equals\nthe position (B is provided when <a href=\"#finalizing-the-contest\">finalizing the\ncontest</a>; the default value\nis 0).</li>\n<li>Teams that solved fewer problems than the median team are not\nranked at all.</li>\n<li>For the remaining teams, the rank is determined by sorting the\nteams by number of problems solved (descending).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The <em>award</em> of a team is:\n<ol>\n<li><em>gold</em> if rank is 1 through 4.</li>\n<li><em>silver</em> if rank is 5 through 8.</li>\n<li><em>bronze</em> if rank is 9 through 12+B.</li>\n<li><em>ranked</em> if rank is not 1 through 12+B but the team is ranked.</li>\n<li><em>honorable</em> otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a number of teams are tied for the same position/rank, they all\noccupy the same position/rank and a suitable number of subsequent\npositions/ranks are left empty. For instance, if four teams are tied for\n17th position, they are all in 17th position and positions 18, 19 and 20\nare unoccupied.</p>\n<p>A submission is pending judgement if it has no judgement or if the\njudgement is <strong>Judging Error</strong>. Pending judgements have no effect on\nscoring.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scoreboard\">Scoreboard</h3>\n<p>The <em>current scoreboard</em> lists the teams sorted by position (with\nalphabetical order on university name as tie breaker).</p>\n<p>The scoreboard must include at least the following information.</p>\n<p>For each team:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>university name</li>\n<li>university logo (see <a href=\"#logostargz\">logos.tar.gz</a>)</li>\n<li>team position</li>\n<li>number of problems solved</li>\n<li>total penalty time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each team and problem:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>number of submissions from that team on that problem,</li>\n<li>whether the problem is solved, unsolved or a judgement is pending,</li>\n<li>if the problem is solved, the contest time at which it was solved,</li>\n<li>if the problem is pending judgement, how many submissions are\npending judgement on that problem,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A problem is pending judgement if any submission on it is pending\njudgement and there is not an earlier accepted submission on that\nproblem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"data-export\">Data Export</h2>\n<h3 id=\"contest-api\">Contest API</h3>\n<p>It is a requirement that

Participants in a WF contest (teams, judges, contest\nadministrators, etc.) connect only to the Primary CCS; all\nparticipant-visible contest operations are handled by the Primary CCS\nand the final results of the contest are computed by the Primary CCS.</p>\n<p>In order to insure accuracy of the final contest results, each World\nFinals also runs an independent “parallel” CCS called the <em>Shadow CCS</em>.\nThe main task of the Shadow CCS is to verify that the final results\ncomputed by the Primary CCS are correct according to the rules of the\nWorld Finals. A contest control system acting as a Shadow CCS is said to\nbe running in <em>shadow mode</em>. This section defines requirements which\nmust be implemented by a CCS related to shadow mode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-both-primary-and-shadow-modes\">Support for both Primary and Shadow Modes</h3>\n<p>A CCS must be able to operate in either Primary or Shadow mode. This\nmeans that it must in principle be possible to run two identical\ninstances of the CCS, one set to run in Primary mode and the other set\nto run in Shadow mode, and where the two CCS instances communicate with\neach other as defined by the requirements of this section and where each\nCCS instance performs all of the required operations of a Primary or\nShadow CCS respectively. A CCS will not be considered as a candidate for\nuse at the World Finals unless it meets all of the requirements\nspecified in this document, including all of the requirements listed in\nthis section. That is, a CCS will not be considered as a candidate for\nuse at the World Finals unless it is capable of operating both as a\nPrimary CCS and as a Shadow CCS.</p>\n<p>The requirement for the ability to run in either Primary mode or Shadow\nmode does not imply that a CCS must be able to operate in these modes\nsimultaneously, nor that a CCS must be able to switch between these\nmodes dynamically during a contest. Rather, it means that in order to be\neligible to be a candidate for use at the World Finals, a CCS must\nsupport BOTH Primary and Shadow-mode operations and must meet all of the\nrequirements for both modes, regardless of which mode it would actually\nbe used in for the particular World Finals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"external-communication\">External Communication</h3>\n<p>Beyond communicating with its own components (e.g., communicating with\nits external “auto-judges” or with the humans managing it), the only\nexternal communication which a CCS running in shadow mode is allowed to\nrequire is that it has the ability to communicate with at least one\n“server” component of the Primary CCS. In particular, a CCS running in\nshadow mode may not require that it be able to communicate directly with\nany of the actual contest participants (meaning the teams, judges, or\ncontest administrators who communicate with the Primary CCS).</p>\n<p>Said another way, the Shadow CCS must be able to perform all of its\nfunctions while communicating only with the Primary CCS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ccs-configuration\">CCS Configuration</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must be able to import a complete contest\nconfiguration as described in the <a href=\"#importing-contest-configuration\">Importing Contest\nConfiguration</a> section of\nthis Requirements Specification. In particular a shadow-mode CCS must be\nable to import a contest configuration from a single URL and must also\nbe able to import the teams.tsv and groups.tsv files as specified in\nthat section.</p>\n<h3 id=\"submissions-1\">Submissions</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must be able to obtain team submissions via\ncommunication with the Primary CCS. As required elsewhere in this\nspecification, the Primary CCS must implement the endpoints defined\nin the <a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a>. The following\nrequirements then apply to the mechanisms used by the Shadow CCS for\nobtaining submissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Shadow CCS should use the <code>/event-feed</code> endpoint defined in the\n<a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> to obtain notification of team\nsubmissions from the Primary CCS (in other words, the Shadow CCS\nshould preferably use event-driven operation, rather than polling,\nfor team submission notification).</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must use the <code>/submissions/&lt;id&gt;</code> and\n<code>/submissions/&lt;id&gt;/files</code> endpoints defined in the\n<a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> for obtaining submission data from the\nPrimary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must provide an interface that can display\ninformation regarding any submission by looking up the submission\nusing the submission id assigned by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS must use the timestamp assigned to a submission by\nthe Primary CCS as the time of the submission for purposes of\ncomputing standings, regardless of the time at which the submission\nis actually obtained by the Shadow CCS.</li>\n<li>A submission obtained from the Primary CCS must be executed and\njudged by the Shadow CCS in the same manner as if it had been\nsubmitted to the CCS running in non-shadow mode.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"judgement-comparison\">Judgement Comparison</h3>\n<p>A CCS running in shadow mode must the capability to present a “diff” of\nsubmissions – that is, a list of all submissions which at the current\ntime have a different judgement than that which was assigned by the\nPrimary CCS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"requirements-which-may-be-imposed-by-the-ccs\">Requirements Which May Be Imposed By The CCS</h3>\n<p>A CCS may require the following conditions to exist in order to\nguarantee support for shadow-mode operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Shadow CCS is provided with “auto-judging” hardware which is the\nsame as that being used by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS has a network connection to both the Event Feed and\nthe REST services provided by the Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS is provided with credentials which allow appropriate\naccess to the required Primary CCS REST endpoints.</li>\n<li>SubmissionIDs for submissions are unique contest-wide, even in the\nevent of a contest with multiple independent sites being managed by\na single distributed Primary CCS.</li>\n<li>The Shadow CCS has access to the same contest configuration files as\nthose used to configure the Primary CCS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A CCS may not require any conditions not specified above to exist in\norder to guarantee support for shadow-mode operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation-requirements\">Documentation Requirements</h2>\n<p>In order for a given CCS to be considered as a candidate for running the\nICPC World Finals contest, the following documents must be submitted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A text file named “License” containing the license, conforming to\nthe <a href=\"#licensing\">Licensing</a> section, under which the CCS is made\navailable to the ICPC.</li>\n<li>A <em>Requirements Compliance Document</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Team Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Judge’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>Contest Administrator’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n<li>A <em>System Manager’s Guide</em> as defined below.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"requirements-compliance-document\">Requirements Compliance Document</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a <em>Requirements Compliance Document</em> in PDF format,\nthat for each requirement (referencing by section number) in this\ndocument confirms that the CCS conforms and explains how that is. In the\nevent that a configuration item is provided by using services of the\nunderlying operating system rather than facilities directly implemented\nor controlled by the CCS itself, this fact must be explicitly stated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"team-guide\">Team Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Team Guide” in PDF format. The Team Guide must\nprovide all the necessary instructions showing how a contest team uses\nthe functions of the team interface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"judges-guide\">Judge’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Judge’s Guide” in PDF format. The Judge’s Guide\nmust provide all the necessary instructions showing how a human contest\njudge uses the functions of the human judge interface.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contest-administrators-guide\">Contest Administrator’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “Contest Administrator’s Guide” in PDF format.\nThe Administrator’s Guide must provide all the necessary instructions\nshowing how contest personnel use the functions of the CCS to set up and\nmanage a contest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system-managers-guide\">System Manager’s Guide</h3>\n<p>The CCS must include a “System Manager’s Guide” document in PDF format.\nThe System Manager’s Guide must describe the steps required to install\nand start the CCS on the OS platform specified for use in the World\nFinals. In the event that the CCS consists of multiple modules and/or\npackages, the guide must contain a description of the relationship\nbetween the modules or packages, including any specific installation\nand/or startup steps required for each module or package.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must provide instructions to contest\npersonnel explaining situations (if any) where the CCS uses functions of\nthe underlying operating system (OS) platform to meet requirements laid\nout in this document. For example, if the CCS relies on the use of OS\naccount and password management to implement requirements related to\ncontest security and credentials, or print services provided by the OS\nto implement requirements related to external notifications, this must\nbe described in the System Manager’s Guide.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must explicitly list any operating system\ndependencies of the CCS, including but not limited to which OS platform\nand version are required and which optional OS packages must be\ninstalled for the CCS to function properly.</p>\n<p>The System Manager’s Guide must explicitly list any software\ndependencies of the CCS. For example, any tools such as Java, PERL,\nWebServer, Browser, database systems, etc., which are required for\ncorrect operation of the CCS must be listed in the guide, including\nspecific version numbers of each tool which the CCS requires for its\ncorrect operation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appendix-file-formats\">Appendix: File formats</h2>\n<p>All files must be encoded in UTF-8.</p>\n<h3

However,\nfor future compatibility below are already listed other methods with\ntheir expected behavior, if implemented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>GET</code>\nRead data. This method is idempotent and does not modify any data.\nIt can be used to request a whole collection or a specific object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>POST</code>\nCreate a new object. This can only be called on a collection\nendpoint, and the <code>id</code> property may not be specified as it is up\nto the server to assign one.\nIf successful the response will contain a <code>Location</code> header\npointing to the newly created object.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>PUT</code>\nCreates or replaces a specific object. This method is idempotent, can only\nbe called on a specific object, and replaces its contents with the\ndata provided. The payload data must be complete, i.e. the <code>id</code> is\nrequired and no partial updates are allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>PATCH</code>\nUpdates/modifies a specific object. This method is idempotent,\ncan only be called on a specific object, and replaces the given\nproperties with the data provided. For example\n<code>PATCH https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/teams/10</code>\nwith JSON contents <code>{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Our cool new team name&quot;}</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>DELETE</code>\nDelete a specific object. Idempotent, but will return a <code>404</code> error\ncode when repeated. Any provided data is ignored, and there is no response body if successful.\nExample: <code>DELETE https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/teams/8</code>.\nNote that deletes must keep <a href=\"#referential-integrity\">referential integrity</a> intact.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"success-failure-and-http-responses\">Success, Failure, and HTTP Responses</h4>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\">HTTP status codes</a> are\nreturned to indicate success or failure. If successful DELETE will have no response body,\nGET on a collection will return the collection, and every other method will contain the\ncurrent (updated) state of the object.</p>\n<p>If a POST, PUT, PATCH would cause any of the following issues it must fail, in addition to any endpoint or type-specific requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A PATCH on an <code>id</code> that doesn’t exist. Will return a 404 error code.</li>\n<li>A PUT or PATCH containing an id that does not match the URL. Will return a 409 error code.</li>\n<li>A required property is missing.</li>\n<li>A property that must not be provided is provided.</li>\n<li>A property type that is incorrect or otherwise invalid (e.g. non-nullable property set to null).</li>\n<li>A reference to another object is invalid (to maintain <a href=\"#referential-integrity\">referential integrity</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to any endpoint or object-specific requirements, DELETE must fail\nif the object <code>id</code> doesn’t exist, and return a 404 error code.\nIf the object being deleted is referenced by another object, the server must either\nfail or implement a cascading delete (to maintain <a href=\"#referential-integrity\">referential integrity</a>)</p>\n<p>When there is a failure using any method the response message body\nmust include a JSON object that contains the properties ‘code’ (a number,\nidentical to the HTTP status code returned) and ‘message’ (a string) with\nfurther information suitable for the client making the request, as per the\nfollowing example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nl\">\"code\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">403</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n </span><span class=\"nl\">\"message\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Teams cannot send clarifications to another team\"</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<h3 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h3>\n<p>The API provider may allow unauthenticated access to information\nthat is fully public, i.e. that may be visible to everyone including\nspectators and teams. If provided this must be read-only access\n(no <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code> or <code>DELETE</code> methods allowed).</p>\n<p>All other access to the API must be controlled via\nauthenticated accounts. The API provider must support <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication\">HTTP basic\nauthentication</a>\n(<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617\">RFC</a>). This provides a standard\nand flexible method; besides HTTP basic auth, other forms of\nauthentication can be offered as well.</p>\n<p>Depending on the client account’s access, the API provider may completely\nhide some objects from the client, may omit certain properties, or may embargo or\nomit objects based on the current state of the contest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"referential-integrity\">Referential integrity</h3>\n<p>Some properties in an object are references to IDs of other objects.\nWhen such a property has a non-<code>null</code> value, then the referenced\nobject must exist. That is, the full set of data exposed by the API\nmust at all times be referentially intact. This implies for example that\nbefore creating a <a href=\"#teams\">team</a> with an <code>organization_id</code>,\nthe <a href=\"#organizations\">organization</a> must already exist. In\nreverse, that organization can only be deleted after the team is\ndeleted, or alternatively, the team’s <code>organization_id</code> is set to\n<code>null</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the ID property (see below) of objects are not allowed to\nchange. However, note that a particular ID might be reused by first\ndeleting an object and then creating a new object with the same ID.</p>\n<h3 id=\"json-property-types\">JSON property types</h3>\n<p>Property types are specified as one of the standard JSON types, or one of the\nmore specific types defined below. Implementations must be consistent with\nrespect to the optional parts of each type, e.g. if the optional .uuu is\nincluded in any absolute timestamp it must be included when outputting all\nabsolute timestamps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strings (type <strong><code>string</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON strings.</li>\n<li>Numbers (type <strong><code>number</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON numbers.</li>\n<li>Booleans (type <strong><code>boolean</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON booleans.</li>\n<li>Integers\n(type <strong><code>integer</code></strong> in the specification) are JSON numbers that are\nrestricted to be integer. They should be represented in standard\ninteger representation <code>(-)?[0-9]+</code>.</li>\n<li>Absolute timestamps\n(type <strong><code>TIME</code></strong> in the specification) are strings containing\nhuman-readable timestamps, given in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> extended combined\ndate/time format with timezone:\n<code>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss(.uuu)?[+-]zz(:mm)?</code> (or timezone <code>Z</code> for UTC).</li>\n<li>Relative times\n(type <strong><code>RELTIME</code></strong> in the specification) are strings containing\nhuman-readable time durations, given in a slight modification of the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> extended time\nformat: <code>(-)?(h)*h:mm:ss(.uuu)?</code></li>\n<li>Identifiers\n(type <strong><code>ID</code></strong> in the specification) are given as string consisting\nof characters <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]</code> of length at most 36 and not starting\nwith a <code>-</code> (dash) or <code>.</code> (dot) or ending with a <code>.</code> (dot). IDs are\nunique within each endpoint. IDs are assigned by the person or system\nthat is the source of the object, and must be maintained by downstream\nsystems. For example, the person configuring a contest on disk will\ntypically define the ID for each team, and any CCS or CDS that exposes\nthe team must use the same ID.\nSome IDs are also used as identifiable labels and are marked below\nalong with the recommended format. These IDs should be meaningful\nfor human communication (e.g. team “43”, problem “A”) and are as\nshort as reasonable but not more than 10 characters. IDs not marked\nas labels may be random characters and cannot be assumed to be\nsuitable for display purposes.</li>\n<li>File references\n(type <strong><code>FILE</code></strong> in the specification) are represented as a JSON object\nwith properties as defined below.</li>\n<li>Arrays (type <strong><code>array of &lt;type&gt;</code></strong> in the specification) are built-in JSON\narrays of some type defined above.</li>\n<li>Nullable types (type <strong><code>&lt;type&gt; ?</code></strong> in the specification) are either a\nvalue of a type defined above, or <code>null</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Properties for file reference objects:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>href</td>\n<td>string ?</td>\n<td>URL where the resource can be found.

For example, if\n<code>baseurl</code> is <a href=\"https://example.com/api\">https://example.com/api</a>, then the following are\nequivalent JSON response snippets pointing to the same location:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/submissions/187/files\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"href\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"contests/wf14/submissions/187/files\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<p>For images, the supported mime types are image/png, image/jpeg, and image/svg+xml.</p>\n<p>For images in SVG format, i.e. those having a mime type of image/svg+xml,\nthe values of <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> should be the viewport width and height in pixels\nwhen possible, but otherwise the actual values don’t matter as long as they\nare positive and represent the correct aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>If implementing support for uploading files pointed to by resource\nlinks, substitute the href property with a data property with a base64\nencoded string of the associated file contents as the value.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<p><code>PUT https://example.com/api/contests/wf14/organizations/inst105</code></p>\n<p>with JSON data</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"inst105\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Carnegie Mellon University\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"err\">...</span><span class=\"w\">\n  </span><span class=\"nl\">\"logo\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"nl\">\"data\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"&lt;base64 string&gt;\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"width\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">160</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"height\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">160</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<h3 id=\"capabilities\">Capabilities</h3>\n<p>The API specifies several\ncapabilities that define behaviors that clients can expect and\nactions they can perform. For instance, a team account will typically\nhave access to a “team_submit” capability that allows a team to perform\nPOST operations on the submissions endpoint, but doesn’t allow it to\nset the submission id or timestamp; an administrator may have access\nto a “contest_start” capability that allows it to PATCH the start\ntime of the contest. These coarse-grained capabilities allow more\nflexibility for contest administrators and tools to define capabilities\nthat match the requirements of a specific contest, e.g. whether teams\ncan submit clarifications or not.</p>\n<p>All capabilities are listed in the table below, and are defined\ninline with each endpoint.

Both\nmechanisms use the same payload format, but have different benefits,\ndrawbacks, and ways to access. Webhooks are typically better for\ninternet-scale, asynchronous processing, and disconnected systems; the\nHTTP feed, on the other hand, might be better for browser-based\napplications and onsite contests.</p>\n<p>The notifications are effectively a changelog of create, update, or\ndelete events that have occurred in the REST endpoints. Some endpoints\n(specifically the <a href=\"#scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> and the Event feed)\nare aggregated data, and so these will only ever update due to some\nother REST endpoint updating. For this reason there is no explicit event\nfor these, since there will always be another event sent.</p>\n<p>The events are served as JSON objects, with every event corresponding to\na change in a single object (submission, judgement, language, team,\netc.) or entire collection.

id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h3>\n<p>This specification is meant to cover the basic data of contests, with\nthe idea that server/client implementations can extend this with more\nendpoints, properties, and/or capabilities. The following requirements\nare meant to ease extensibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients should accept additional (unknown) event types in notifications.</li>\n<li>Clients should accept additional (unknown) properties in endpoints.</li>\n<li>Clients should accept additional (unknown) capabilities.</li>\n<li>Servers should not expect clients to recognize more than the basic,\nrequired specification.</li>\n<li>In this specification and extensions, a property with value <code>null</code>\nmay be left out by the server (i.e. not be present). A client must\ntreat a property with value <code>null</code> equivalently as that property\nnot being present.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"interface-specification\">Interface specification</h2>\n<p>The following list of API endpoints should be supported. Note that <code>access</code>,\n<code>state</code>, <code>scoreboard</code> and <code>event-feed</code> are singular nouns and indeed\ncontain only a single object.</p>\n<p>All endpoints should support <code>GET</code>; specific details on other methods\nare mentioned below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"types-of-endpoints\">Types of endpoints</h3>\n<p>The endpoints can be categorized into 4 groups as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Metadata: api, access</li>\n<li>Configuration: contests, judgement-types, languages, problems,\ngroups, organizations, teams, team-members;</li>\n<li>Live data: state, submissions, judgements, runs, clarifications,\nawards, commentary;</li>\n<li>Aggregate data: scoreboard, event-feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Metadata is data about the API. These are not included in the event feed and\nare always required to be available. The access endpoint specifies which other\nendpoints are offered by the API.</p>\n<p>Configuration is normally set before contest start. Is not expected to,\nbut could occasionally be updated during a contest. It does not have\nassociated timestamp/contest time property. Updates are notified via\nthe event feed.</p>\n<p>Live data is generated during the contest and new objects are expected.\nData is immutable though: only inserts, no updates or deletes of\nobjects. It does have associated timestamp/contest time property.\nInserts and deletes are notified via the event feed. <strong>Note</strong>:\njudgements are the exception to immutability in a weak sense: they get\nupdated once with the final verdict.</p>\n<p>Aggregate data: Only <code>GET</code> makes sense. These are not included in the\nevent feed, also note that these should not be considered proper REST\nendpoints, and that the <code>event-feed</code> endpoint is a streaming feed in\nNDJSON format.</p>\n<h3 id=\"table-column-description\">Table column description</h3>\n<p>In the tables below, the columns are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Property name; object sub-properties are indicated as\n<code>property.subproperty</code>.</li>\n<li>Type: Data type of the property; one of the\n<a href=\"#json-property-types\">types listed above</a>.</li>\n<li>Description: Description of the meaning of the property and any\nspecial considerations. Required means that the property must be present\nand must not be <code>null</code>. Default values specify how missing or <code>null</code>\nvalues should be interpreted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that all results returned from endpoints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Must only have <code>null</code> values if the type of the property is <code>&lt;type&gt; ?</code>.</li>\n<li>Must contain all properties specified in the <a href=\"#access\">Access</a> endpoint\nthat have non-<code>null</code> values.</li>\n<li>Should not contain any properties not specified in the <a href=\"#access\">Access</a>\nendpoint.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"filtering\">Filtering</h3>\n<p>Endpoints that return a JSON array must allow filtering on any\nproperty with type ID (except the <code>id</code> property) by passing it as a\nquery argument. For example, clarifications can be filtered on the\nrecipient by passing <code>to_team_id=X</code>. To filter on a <code>null</code> value,\npass an empty string, i.e. <code>to_team_id=</code>.

At the World Finals these are the super regions; at other contests these\nmay be the different sites, divisions, or types of contestants.</p>\n<p>Teams may belong to multiple groups. For instance, there may be a group for each site, a group for\nuniversity teams, a group for corporate teams, and a group for ICPC-eligible teams. Teams could\nbelong to two or three of these.\nWhen there are different kinds of groups for different purposes (e.g. sites vs divisions), each\ngroup or set of groups should have a different type property\n(e.g. <code>&quot;type&quot;:&quot;site&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;type&quot;:&quot;division&quot;</code>).</p>\n<p>Groups must exist for any combination of teams that must be ranked on a\n<a href=\"#group-scoreboard\">group scoreboard</a>, which means groups may be created for combinations of\nother groups. For instance, if there is a requirement to show a scoreboard for teams in each of <code>D</code>\ndivisions at every one of <code>S</code> sites, then in addition to the <code>D</code> + <code>S</code> groups there will also be\n<code>D</code>x<code>S</code> combined/product groups. It is recommended that these groups have a type like\n<code>&quot;type&quot;:&quot;&lt;group1&gt;-&lt;group2&gt;&quot;</code>, e.g. <code>&quot;type&quot;:&quot;site-division&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>The following endpoints are associated with groups:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Endpoint</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Mime-type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/groups</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">application/json</td>\n<td align=\"left\">JSON array of all groups with properties as specified by <code>/access</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/groups/&lt;id&gt;</code></td>\n<td align=\"left\">application/json</td>\n<td align=\"left\">JSON object representing a single group with properties as specified by <code>/access</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note that these endpoints must be provided if groups are used.

Specifically, for Python\nit is the file name that should be run, and for Java and Kotlin it is\nthe fully qualified class name (that is, with any package name included,\ne.g. <code>com.example.myclass</code> for a class in the package <code>com.example</code> in\nJava). For C and C++ no entry point is required and it must therefore be\n<code>null</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>files</code> property provides the file(s) of a given submission as a\nzip archive. These must be stored directly from the root of the zip\nfile, i.e. there must not be extra directories (or files) added unless\nthese are explicitly part of the submission content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"modifying-submissions\">Modifying submissions</h4>\n<p>To add a submission, clients can use the <code>POST</code> method on the submissions endpoint or the\n<code>PUT</code> method directly on an object url. One of the following <a href=\"#capabilities\">capabilities</a>\nis required to add submissions, with descriptions below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Name</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">team_submit</td>\n<td align=\"left\">POST a submission as a team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">proxy_submit</td>\n<td align=\"left\">POST a submission as a proxy (able to submit on behalf of team(s))</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">admin_submit</td>\n<td align=\"left\">POST or PUT a submission as an admin</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All requests must include a valid JSON object with the same properties as the submissions\nendpoint returns from a <code>GET</code> request with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property <code>team_id</code>, <code>time</code>, and <code>contest_time</code> are\noptional depending on the use case (see below). The server\nmay require properties to either be absent or present, and should\nrespond with a 4xx error code in such cases.</li>\n<li>Since <code>files</code> only supports <code>application/zip</code>, providing the <code>mime</code> property is\noptional.</li>\n<li><code>reaction</code> may be provided but a CCS does not have to honour it.</li>\n<li>The <code>team_submit</code> capability only has access to <code>POST</code>. <code>time</code>\nmust not be provided and will always be set to the\ncurrent time as determined by the server. <code>team_id</code> may be provided but then\nmust match the ID of the team associated with the request.</li>\n<li>The <code>proxy_submit</code> capability only has access to <code>POST</code>. <code>time</code>\nmust not be provided and will always be set to the\ncurrent time as determined by the server. <code>team_id</code> must be provided.</li>\n<li>For more advanced scenarios the <code>admin_submit</code> capability may use a <code>POST</code> (must not\ninclude an <code>id</code>) or <code>PUT</code> (client is required to include a unique <code>id</code>). In both\ncases <code>time</code> is required. For example in a setup with a central CCS with satellite sites\nwhere teams submit to a proxy CCS that forwards to the central CCS, this might be\nuseful to make sure that the proxy CCS can accept submissions even when the connection\nto the central CCS is down. The proxy can then forward these submissions later, when\nthe connection is restored again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The request must fail with a 4xx error code if any of the following happens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A required property is missing.</li>\n<li>A property that must not be provided is provided.</li>\n<li>The supplied problem, team or language can not be found.</li>\n<li>An entrypoint is required for the given language, but not supplied.</li>\n<li>The mime property in <code>files</code> is set but invalid.</li>\n<li>Something is wrong with the submission file. For example it contains too many\nfiles, it is too big, etc.</li>\n<li>The provided <code>id</code> already exists or is otherwise not acceptable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The response will contain a <code>Location</code> header pointing to the newly created submission\nand the response body will contain the initial state of the submission.</p>\n<p>Performing a <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> is not supported when these capabilities are not available.</p>\n<h4 id=\"use-cases-for-posting-and-putting-submissions\">Use cases for POSTing and PUTting submissions</h4>\n<p>The POST and PUT submissions endpoint can be used for a variety of reasons,\nand depending on the use case, the server might require different\nproperties to be present. A number of common scenarios are described here\nfor informational purposes only.</p>\n<h5 id=\"team-client-submitting-to-ccs\">Team client submitting to CCS</h5>\n<p>The most obvious and probably most common case is where a team\ndirectly submits to the CCS, e.g. with a command-line submit client.</p>\n<p>In this case the client has the <code>team_submit</code> capability and a specific <code>team_id</code>\nalready associated with it. POST must be used and the properties <code>id</code>,\n<code>team_id</code>, <code>time</code>, and <code>contest_time</code> should not be specified; the server will\ndetermine these properties and should reject submissions specifying\nthem, or may ignore a <code>team_id</code> that is identical to the one that the\nclient has authenticated as.</p>\n<h5 id=\"a-proxy-server-forwarding-to-a-ccs\">A proxy server forwarding to a CCS</h5>\n<p>A proxy server may receive submissions from team clients (like above)\nand forward these to a CCS. This might be useful, for example, in a\nmulti-site contest setup, where each site runs a proxy that would\nstill be reachable if connectivity with the central CCS is lost, or\nwhere the proxy forwards the submission to multiple CCS’s that run in\nparallel (like the shadowing setup at the ICPC World Finals).</p>\n<p>In such a scenario, the proxy server would timestamp the submissions\nand authenticate the submitting team, and then forward the submission\nto the upstream CCS using the <code>proxy_submit</code> capability. The proxy would provide\n<code>team_id</code> and <code>time</code> properties and the CCS should then accept and use\nthese.</p>\n<p>To allow the proxy to return a submission <code>id</code> during connectivity\nloss, the <code>admin_submit</code> capability would be required and each site\ncould be assigned a unique prefix such that the proxy\nserver itself can generate unique <code>id</code>s and then submit a PUT to the central\nCCS with the <code>id</code> property included. The central CCS should then\naccept and use that <code>id</code> property.</p>\n<h5 id=\"further-potential-extensions\">Further potential extensions</h5>\n<p>To allow for any further use cases, the specification is deliberately\nflexible in how the server can handle optional properties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>contest_time</code> property should normally not be specified when\n<code>time</code> is already specified as it can be calculated from <code>time</code> and\nthe wallclock time is unambiguously defined without reference to\ncontest start time. However, in a case where one would want to\nsupport a multi-site contest where the sites run out of sync, the\nuse of <code>contest_time</code> might be considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4

Specifically,\nthey can POST new awards, create or replace one with a known id via PUT,\nPATCH one or more properties, or DELETE an existing award.</p>\n<p>The server may be configured to manage (assign or update) some award\nids, and may block clients from modifying them. However, if a client is\nable to modify an award it must assume that it is responsible for\nmanaging that award id unless and until it sees an indication that\nsomething else is now managing that award - either a change that it did\nnot request, or a future modification fails.</p>\n<p>For example, the server may be configured to assign the <code>winner</code> award\nand not allow any client to modify it. The same server may assign\n<code>*-medal</code> awards by default, but allow clients to modify them. Once a\nclient modifies any of the <code>*-medal</code> awards, it is responsible for\nupdating it if anything changes. Likewise, the client could add any\narbitrary awards like <code>first-submission-for-country-*</code> and would be\nresponsible for managing these.</p>\n<p>The server should create all the awards it is configured to manage\nbefore the start of the contest, so that clients can know which awards\nare already handled.</p>\n<p>The request must fail with a 4xx error code if any of the following\nhappens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A POST that includes an id.</li>\n<li>A PATCH, or DELETE on an award that doesn’t exist.</li>\n<li>A POST or PUT that is missing one of the required properties (<code>citation</code> and <code>team_ids</code>).</li>\n<li>A PATCH that contains an invalid property (e.g. null <code>citation</code> or <code>team_ids</code>).</li>\n<li>A PUT or PATCH that includes an award id that doesn’t match the id in the url.</li>\n<li>A POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE on an award id that the server is configured to manage exclusively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4

align=\"left\">NDJSON feed of events as defined in <a href=\"#notification-format\">notification format</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The event feed is a streaming HTTP endpoint that allows connected\nclients to receive change notifications. The feed is a complete log of\ncontest objects that starts “at the beginning of time” so all existing\nobjects will be sent upon initial connection, but may appear in any\norder (e.g. teams or problems first).</p>\n<p>Each line is an NDJSON formatted notification. The feed does not\nterminate under normal circumstances, so to ensure keep alive a newline\nmust be sent if there has been no event within 120 seconds.</p>\n<p>Since this is generated data, only the <code>GET</code> method is allowed for this\nendpoint, irrespective of role.</p>\n<h4 id=\"general-requirements\">General requirements</h4>\n<p>Every notification provides the current state of a single contest\nobject. There is no guarantee on order of events (except for general\nrequirements below), whether two consecutive changes cause one or two\nevents, duplicate events, or even that different clients will receive\nthe same order or set of events. The only guarantees are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when an object changes one or more times a notification will be sent,</li>\n<li>the latest notification sent for any object is the correct and current\nstate of that object. E.g. if an object was created and deleted the\ndelete notification will be sent last.</li>\n<li>when a notification is sent the change it decsribes must already have\nhappened. I.e. if a client receives an update for a certain endpoint a\n<code>GET</code> from that endpoint will return that state or possible some later\nstate, but never an earlier state.</li>\n<li>the notification for the <a href=\"#contest-state\">state endpoint</a> setting\n<code>end_of_updates</code> must be the last event in the feed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"reconnection\">Reconnection</h5>\n<p>If a client loses connection or needs to reconnect after a brief\ndisconnect (e.g. client restart), it can use the ‘time’ parameter to\nspecify the last event it received:</p>\n<p><code>/event-feed?time=xx</code></p>\n<p>If specified, the server will attempt to start sending events around the\ngiven time to reduce the volume of events and required reconciliation.\nIf the time passed is too large or the server does not support this\nparameter, all objects will be sent. There is no guarantee that all\nupdates (e.g. a team name correction, which is not time-based) that\noccurred during the time the client was disconnected will be reflected.</p>\n<h5

Callbacks to each client are always\nsent synchronously and in order; clients do not need to worry about\ngetting callbacks out of order and should always process each callback\nfully before processing the next one.</p>\n<p>If the client fails to respond to multiple requests over a period of\ntime (configured for each contest), it will be assumed deactivated and\nautomatically removed from future callbacks.</p>\n<h5 id=\"adding-a-webhook\">Adding a webhook</h5>\n<p>To register a webhook, you need to post your server’s callback URL. To\ndo so, perform a <code>POST</code> request with a JSON body with the properties (except\n<code>id</code>) from the above table to the <code>/webhooks</code> endpoint together with one\nadditional property, called <code>token</code>. In this property put a client-generated\ntoken that can be used to verify that callbacks come from the CCS. If\nyou don’t supply <code>contest_ids</code> and/or <code>endpoints</code>, they will default to\n<code>[]</code>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"examples-21\">Examples</h5>\n<p>Request:</p>\n<p><code>POST https://example.com/api/webhooks</code></p>\n<p>Payload:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nl\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://myurl\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nl\">\"token\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"mysecrettoken\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<p>Request:</p>\n<p><code>GET https://example.com/api/webhooks</code></p>\n<p>Returned data:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">[{</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"icpc-live\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://myurl\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"endpoints\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"contest_ids\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"active\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">},{</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"shadow\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"url\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"https://myotherurl\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"endpoints\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"teams\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">\"problems\"</span><span class=\"p\">],</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"contest_ids\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"wf2014\"</span><span class=\"p\">],</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"nl\">\"active\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}]</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre>  </div></div>\n<p>When a system wants to send out a callback, it will check all active\nwebhooks, filter them on applicable endpoint and contest ID and perform\na <code>POST</code> to the URL.

It describes how to\nstore the information available through the <a href=\"contest_api\">Contest API</a> on\ndisk.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons that contest information will be stored on\ndisk, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As configuration used to initialize a CCS</li>\n<li>As an archive of what happened in a contest</li>\n<li>As an archive for replaying a contest, either for testing contest\ntools or for teams to compete against live data</li>\n<li>As a base for offline analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"archive-contents\">Archive contents</h2>\n<p>The package consists of a single directory containing files as described\nbelow, or alternatively, a ZIP compressed archive of the directory. It is\nstrongly recommended that the name of the directory or the base name of the\narchive match the contest ID, if a contest ID is specified.</p>\n<p>A package contains information regarding a single contest (corresponding to\nthe <code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/*</code> endpoints of the API). The API can contain information\nfor several contests, to store the information for multiple contests a\npackage per contest would be needed.</p>\n<p>Information in the API is always either in JSON format, <a href=\"contest_api#event-feed\">NDJSON</a>\nformat, or linked using a <a href=\"contest_api#json-attribute-types\">file reference</a>\nJSON object.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The JSON returned from the endpoint <code>/</code> is stored as\n<code>api.json</code>.</li>\n<li>The JSON returned from the endpoint <code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;</code> is stored as\n<code>contest.json</code>. (Notice the singular form).</li>\n<li>The JSON returned from the endpoint <code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> is stored as\n<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;.json</code>.</li>\n<li>The NDJSON returned from the endpoint <code>/contests/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> is stored as\n<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;.ndjson</code>. (The only such endpoint is <code>event-feed</code>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Files referenced in <code>contest.json</code> are stored as <code>contest/&lt;filename&gt;</code>, and\nfiles referenced in <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;.json</code> are stored as\n<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</code>, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;id&gt;</code> is the ID of the endpoint object the reference is in.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is the filename specified in the file reference object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the API specification requires that filenames are unique within\nendpoint objects, so this is always possible.</p>\n<p>It is not required that a URL specified in an href is always valid.\nSpecifically, in many cases the contest is running in a local network that is\ntaken down after the contest, and in this case the URL would definitely not\nstill be working. To keep the archiving process as simple as possible, stale\nURLs do not have to be removed from the data, but due to this the URLs should\nbe ignored and the file stored as specified above should be used instead.</p>\n<p>Optionally one could create a Shallow Archive by not storing the files, in\nwhich case the URLs must be valid. This could be useful in some cases where\nthe size of the archive matters.</p>\n<p>In some cases it could make sense to merge multiple API sources (of the same\ncontest) in a single archive. One example of this would be a contest that was\nrunning with a primary and <a href=\"ccs_system_requirements#shadow-mode\">shadow</a> CCS.\nTypically in such cases, most of the data is identical (or at least the\ndifferences are irrelevant), so only the data that differs (in relevant ways)\nneeds to be stored. If there is an additional source for <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> it is\nstored as above, but wherever <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> is used in the path, instead use\n<code>&lt;endpoint&gt;_&lt;system&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;system&gt;</code> is a unique name for the additional\nsource.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-uses\">Example uses</h2>\n<p>The rest of the document describes use cases for the Archive Format, listing\nwhich data would be required for that use case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ccs-configuration\">CCS configuration</h3>\n<p>Used for configuring a CCS (primary or shadow) before a contest.
